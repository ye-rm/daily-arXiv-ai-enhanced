Existing SVM designs rely solely on linear or Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) kernels, forcing a trade-off between hardware costs and\naccuracy. Linear kernels, implemented digitally, minimize overhead but\nsacrifice performance, while the more accurate RBF kernels are prohibitively\nlarge in digital, and their analog realization contains inherent functional\napproximation. In this work, we propose the first mixed-kernel and mixed-signal\nSVM design in FE, which unifies the advantages of both implementations and\nbalances the cost/accuracy trade-off. To that end, we introduce a\nco-optimization approach that trains our mixed-kernel SVMs and maps binary SVM\nclassifiers to the appropriate kernel (linear/RBF) and domain (digital/analog),\naiming to maximize accuracy whilst reducing the number of costly RBF\nclassifiers.

In\nthis research, we introduce QAGT-MLP: an attention-based graph transformer\ntailored for small- and large-scale quantum error mitigation (QEM). QAGT-MLP\nencodes each quantum circuit as a graph whose nodes represent gate instances\nand whose edges capture qubit connectivity and causal adjacency. A dual-path\nattention module extracts features around measured qubits at two scales or\ncontexts: 1) graph-wide global structural context; and 2) fine-grained local\nlightcone context.
