However, the\nconventional bulk synchronous parallel~(BSP) model used in such settings\nintroduces significant performance inefficiencies. To characterize these\nbottlenecks, we introduce the ''Three Taxes'' (Bulk Synchronous, Inter-Kernel\nData Locality, and Kernel Launch Overhead) as an analytical framework. We\npropose moving beyond the rigid BSP model to address key inefficiencies in\ndistributed GPU execution. By exploiting libraries like Iris for Triton, we\ngain access to in-kernel communication primitives that enable the design of\nnovel fine-grained programming patterns, offering greater flexibility and\nperformance than traditional BSP-based approaches. These patterns\nsystematically eliminate the three taxes by creating direct, tile-level\nproducer-consumer pipelines and replacing global barriers with fine-grained\ndataflow synchronization. Applying this methodology to critical kernels, from\nthe foundational All-Gather + general matrix multiplication operation to the\ncomplex Flash Decode algorithm, we observe a 10-20% speedup in end-to-end\nlatency over BSP-based approaches, establishing a more programmable and\nefficient paradigm for distributed LLM workloads."}

This coarse-grained resource management\nleads to degraded performance or significant resource underutilization due to\npoor adaptability to dynamic inference traffic that is common online.\n  The root cause of this inefficiency lies in the internal structure of\ngenerative models: they are executed as graphs of interconnected operators.\nThrough detailed characterization and systematic analysis, we find that\noperators are heterogeneous in their compute and memory footprints and exhibit\ndiverse sensitivity to workload and resource factors such as batch size,\nsequence length, and traffic rate. This heterogeneity suggests that the\noperator, rather than the entire model, is the right granularity for scaling\ndecisions.\n  We propose an operator-level autoscaling framework, which allocates resources\nat finer (operator)-granularity, optimizing the scaling, batching, and\nplacement based on individual operator profiles. Evaluated on production-scale\ntraces, our approach preserves SLOs with up to 40% fewer GPUs and 35% less\nenergy, or under fixed resources achieves 1.6x higher throughput with 5% less\nenergy.

To address these, we propose Federated Attention\n(FedAttn), which integrates the federated paradigm into the self-attention\nmechanism, creating a new distributed LLM inference framework that\nsimultaneously achieves privacy protection, communication efficiency, and\ncomputational efficiency. FedAttn enables participants to perform local\nself-attention over their own token representations while periodically\nexchanging and aggregating Key-Value (KV) matrices across multiple Transformer\nblocks, collaboratively generating LLM responses without exposing private\nprompts. Further, we identify a structural duality between contextual\nrepresentation refinement in FedAttn and parameter optimization in FL across\nprivate data, local computation, and global aggregation. This key insight\nprovides a principled foundation for systematically porting federated\noptimization techniques to collaborative LLM inference. Building on this\nframework, we theoretically analyze how local self-attention computation within\nparticipants and heterogeneous token relevance among participants shape error\npropagation dynamics across Transformer blocks. Moreover, we characterize the\nfundamental trade-off between response quality and communication/computation\nefficiency, which is governed by the synchronization interval and the number of\nparticipants.

In\nthis direction, this paper presents preliminary time-to-solution results for\ntwo representative scientific computing applications: an N-body simulation and\na structured grid simulation.

Unfortunately, this approach\nmakes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for\nclients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks,\nEgalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows\nreplicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader\nallows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of\nany processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any\nprocess to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more\nthan $e = \\lceil\\frac{f+1}{2}\\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently\nsubmitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in\npractical systems.\n  Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication\nprotocols.
