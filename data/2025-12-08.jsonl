Their small sub-models learn quickly at first but become under-parameterized in later stages, leading to slow convergence and degraded generalization. We propose FedGMR - Federated Learning with Gradual Model Restoration under Asynchrony and Model Heterogeneity. FedGMR progressively increases each client's sub-model density during training, enabling BCCs to remain effective contributors throughout the process. In addition, we develop a mask-aware aggregation rule tailored for asynchronous MHFL and provide convergence guarantees showing that aggregated error scales with the average sub-model density across clients and rounds, while GMR provably shrinks this gap toward full-model FL. Extensive experiments on FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-100 demonstrate that FedGMR achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially under high heterogeneity and non-IID settings."}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity. Thus, we claim: bus-mounted edge servers for vehicular networks in urban areas are feasible, beneficial, and valuable."}
