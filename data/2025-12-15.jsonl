We found that a coil with a magnetic core is an inductor with memory (meminductor) in terms of its inductance L(q) being a function of the charge q. The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance. As an experimental verification, this newly invented meminductor was used to reproduce the observed biological behaviour of amoebae (the memorizing, timing and anticipating mechanisms). In conclusion, a beyond memristor computing paradigm is theoretically sensible and experimentally practical."}

In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is a better energy-efficient algorithm and consumes less energy than the MaxUtil algorithm."}

However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost."}

However, existing reviews often overlook critical technical aspects and practical challenges integral to the usage of live migration techniques in real-world scenarios. This work bridges this gap by integrating the aspects explored in existing reviews together with a comprehensive analysis of live migration technologies across multiple dimensions, with focus on migration techniques, migration units, and infrastructure characteristics. Despite efforts to make live migration widely accessible, its reliance on multiple system factors can create challenges. In certain cases, the complexities and resource demands outweigh the benefits, making its implementation hard to justify. The focus of this work is mainly on container based and virtual machine-based migration technologies, examining the current state of the art and the disparity in adoption between these two approaches. Furthermore, this work explores the impact of migration objectives and operational constraints on the usability and efficacy of existing technologies. By outlining current technical challenges and providing guidelines for future research and development directions, this work serves a dual purpose: first, to equip enthusiasts with a valuable resource on live migration, and second, to contribute to the advancement of live migration technologies and their practical implementation across diverse computing environments."}

This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks."}

Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.\n  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics."}

However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable \"warm-star\" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment."}

Published in a local annal at the University of Kinshasa, although the annal is not indexed", "summary": "Identifying central nodes using closeness centrality is a critical task in analyzing large-scale complex networks, yet its decentralized computation remains challenging due to high communication overhead. Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis."}

We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference."}

However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.\n  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability."}

The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources.
