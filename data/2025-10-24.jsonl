Traditional\ngeneral-purpose accelerators struggle to effectively exploit fine-grain\nparallelism due to limitations in implementing convoluted data-dependency\npatterns (like SIMD) and overheads due to synchronization and data transfers\n(like GPGPUs). In contrast, custom FPGA and ASIC designs offer improved\nperformance and energy efficiency at a high cost in hardware design and\nprogramming complexity and often lack the flexibility to process different\nworkloads. We propose Squire, a general-purpose accelerator designed to exploit\nfine-grain parallelism effectively on dependency-bound kernels. Each Squire\naccelerator has a set of general-purpose low-power in-order cores that can\nrapidly communicate among themselves and directly access data from the L2\ncache.

As a case study, we evaluate\nSquire's effectiveness by accelerating five kernels that implement complex\ndependency patterns. We use three of these kernels to build an end-to-end\nread-mapping tool that will be used to evaluate Squire. Squire obtains speedups\nup to 7.64$\\times$ in dynamic programming kernels.

The main novelties introduced by FLAS are (i) a predictive model\nof the high-level metrics trend which allows to anticipate changes in the\nrelevant SLA parameters (e.g. performance metrics such as response time or\nthroughput) and (ii) a reactive contingency system based on the estimation of\nhigh-level metrics from resource use metrics, reducing the necessary\ninstrumentation (less invasive) and allowing it to be adapted agnostically to\ndifferent applications.
