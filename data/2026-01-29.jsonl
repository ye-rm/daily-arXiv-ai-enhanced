However, existing bit-truncation memories require custom designs for a specific application. In this paper, we present a novel bit-truncation memory with full adaptation flexibility, which can truncate any number of data bits at run time to meet different quality and power trade-off requirements for various approximate applications. The developed bit-truncation memory has been applied to two representative data-intensive approximate applications: video processing and deep learning. Our experiments show that the proposed memory can support three different video applications (including luminance-aware, content-aware, and region-of-interest-aware) with enhanced power efficiency (up to 47.02% power savings) as compared to state-of-the-art. In addition, the proposed memory achieves significant (up to 51.69%) power savings for both baseline and pruned lightweight deep learning models, respectively, with a low implementation cost (2.89% silicon area overhead)."}

Uneven wear of memory is a major barrier. The problem is becoming even more urgent as emerging memory such as phase-change memory is subject to even shorter lifespan. Various solutions have been proposed, but they either require complicated hardware extensions or apply only to certain program constructs such as loops. This research proposes a new method, dual-ring wear leveling. It takes inspiration from the natural law known as the ``golden ratio\" and how it helps flower petals evenly receive sun lights. By modeling memory as two rings and combines the idea with existing memory management, garbage collection, the new solution offers an effective way to reduce memory wear and hence lengthen memory lifespan. It is deterministic, able to automatically adapt to memory size, requiring no hardware changes, and adding no slowdown to program executions."}

The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips."}

However, these implementations have three primary limitations: (1) suboptimal communication patterns for network topologies on modern GPU machines, (2) latency bottlenecks from all-to-all operations in inter-machine communication, and (3) GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads from using two-sided communication libraries. To address these issues, we present StreamFusion, a topology-aware efficient DiT serving engine. StreamFusion incorporates three key innovations: (1) a topology-aware sequence parallelism technique that accounts for inter- and intra-machine bandwidth differences, (2) Torus Attention, a novel SP technique enabling overlapping of inter-machine all-to-all operations with computation, and (3) a one-sided communication implementation that minimizes GPU sender-receiver synchronization and computation overheads.

The method first constructs system state representations from high-dimensional metric sequences, applies nonlinear transformations to extract cross-dimensional dynamic features, and integrates multiple source information such as resource utilization, scheduling behavior, and task load variations within a shared representation space. It then introduces a graph-based modeling mechanism to capture latent dependencies among metrics, allowing the model to learn competitive propagation patterns and structural interference across resource links. On this basis, task-specific mapping structures are designed to model the differences among contention types and enhance the classifier's ability to distinguish multiple contention patterns. To achieve stable performance, the method employs an adaptive multi-task loss weighting strategy that balances shared feature learning with task-specific feature extraction and generates final contention predictions through a standardized inference process. Experiments conducted on a public system trace dataset demonstrate advantages in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1, and sensitivity analyses on batch size, training sample scale, and metric dimensionality further confirm the model's stability and applicability.

To address these issues, we present CHIME, a chiplet-based heterogeneous near-memory acceleration for edge MLLMs inference. CHIME leverages the complementary strengths of integrated monolithic 3D (M3D) DRAM and RRAM chiplets: DRAM supplies low-latency bandwidth for attention, while RRAM offers dense, non-volatile storage for weights. This heterogeneous hardware is orchestrated by a co-designed mapping framework that executes fused kernels near data, minimizing cross-chiplet traffic to maximize effective bandwidth.

Accepted to IEEE CCMCC 2025", "summary": "Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), where weights and activations are constrained to binary values (+1, -1), are a highly efficient alternative to traditional neural networks. Unfortunately, typical BNNs, while binarizing linear layers (matrix-vector multiplication), still implement other network layers (batch normalization, softmax, output layer, and sometimes the input layer of a convolutional neural network) in full precision. This limits the area and energy benefits and requires architectural support for full precision operations. We propose PiC-BNN, a true end-to-end binary in-approximate search (Hamming distance tolerant) Content Addressable Memory based BNN accelerator. PiC-BNN is designed and manufactured in a commercial 65nm process. PiC-BNN uses Hamming distance tolerance to apply the law of large numbers to enable accurate classification without implementing full precision operations. PiC-BNN achieves baseline software accuracy (95.2%) on the MNIST dataset and 93.5% on the Hand Gesture (HG) dataset, a throughput of 560K inferences/s, and presents a power efficiency of 703M inferences/s/W when implementing a binary MLP model for MNIST/HG dataset classification."}

Recent research on Agentic AI (AAI) increasingly integrates reasoning systems powered by Large Language Models; however, these tools are not applicable to infrastructure-level systems due to their high computational cost, stochastic nature, and poor formal analyzability. In this paper, a generic model, Agentic Fog (AF), is presented, in which fog nodes are represented as policy-driven autonomous agents that communicate via p2p interactions based on shared memory and localized coordination. The suggested architecture decomposes a system's goals into abstract policy guidance and formalizes decentralized fog coordination as an exact potential game. The framework is guaranteed to converge and remain stable under asynchronous updates, bounded-rational best-response dynamics, and node failures. Simulations demonstrate that the AF system achieves lower average latency and adapts more efficiently to varying demand than greedy heuristics and integer linear programming under dynamic conditions. The sensitivity analysis also demonstrates the capability to perform optimally under different memory and coordination conditions."}

While their use in high-level synthesis (HLS) remains comparatively less mature, the ratio of HLS- to RTL-focused studies has shifted from 1:10 to 2:10 in the past six months, indicating growing interest in leveraging LLMs for high-level design entry while relying on downstream synthesis for optimization. This growing trend highlights the need for a comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation framework dedicated to LLM-based HLS. To address this, We present Bench4HLS for evaluating LLM-generated HLS designs. Bench4HLS comprises 170 manually drafted and validated case studies, spanning small kernels to complex accelerators, curated from widely used public repositories. The framework supports fully automated assessment of compilation success, functional correctness via simulation, and synthesis feasibility/optimization. Crucially, Bench4HLS integrates a pluggable API for power, performance, and area (PPA) analysis across various HLS toolchains and architectures, demonstrated here with Xilinx Vitis HLS and validated on Catapult HLS. By providing a structured, extensible, and plug-and-play testbed, Bench4HLS establishes a foundational methodology for benchmarking LLMs in HLS workflows."}

By combining intra-chip performance profiling and inter-chip scalability analysis, DABench-LLM enables comprehensive evaluation across key metrics such as resource allocation, load balance, and resource efficiency. The framework helps researchers rapidly gain insights into underlying hardware and system behaviors, and provides guidance for performance optimizations.

However, the high dimensionality, sparsity, and repeated data movement involved in HDC make these computations difficult to accelerate efficiently on conventional processors. As a result, executing core HDC operations: binding, permutation, bundling, and similarity search: on CPUs or GPUs often leads to suboptimal utilization, memory bottlenecks, and limits on real-time performance. In this paper, our contributions are two-fold. First, we develop an image-encoding algorithm that, similar in spirit to convolutional neural networks, maps local image patches to hypervectors enriched with spatial information. These patch-level hypervectors are then merged into a global representation using the fundamental HDC operations, enabling spatially sensitive and robust image encoding. This encoder achieves 95.67% accuracy on MNIST and 85.14% on Fashion-MNIST, outperforming prior HDC-based image encoders. Second, we design an end-to-end accelerator that implements these compute operations on an FPGA through a pipelined architecture that exploits parallelism both across the hypervector dimensionality and across the set of image patches. Our Alveo U280 implementation delivers 0.09ms inference latency, achieving up to 1300x and 60x speedup over state-of-the-art CPU and GPU baselines, respectively."}

In this work, we propose RAPID-Graph to address this challenge through a co-designed processing-in-memory (PIM) system that integrates algorithm, architecture, and device-level optimizations. At the algorithm level, we introduce a recursion-aware partitioner that enables an exact APSP computation by decomposing graphs into vertex tiles to reduce data dependency, such that both Floyd-Warshall and Min-Plus kernels execute fully in-place within digital PIM arrays. At the architecture and device levels, we design a 2.5D PIM stack integrating two phase-change memory compute dies, a logic die, and high-bandwidth scratchpad memory within a unified advanced package. An external non-volatile storage stack stores large APSP results persistently. The design achieves both tile-level and unit-level parallel processing to sustain high throughput. On the 2.45M-node OGBN-Products dataset, RAPID-Graph is 5.8x faster and 1,186x more energy efficient than state-of-the-art GPU clusters, while exceeding prior PIM accelerators by 8.3x in speed and 104x in efficiency.

However, if the complexity can be reduced, priority encoders can feasibly accelerate a variety of key applications, such as high-precision integer arithmetic and content-addressable memory. We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization. We then analyze the complexity and delay of new and existing priority encoder designs as a function of input length, for both FPGA and ASIC implementation technologies. In particular, we compare the multi-level structure to the traditional single-level priority encoder structure, a tree-based design, a recursive design, and the two-level structure. We find that the two-level architecture provides balanced performance -- reducing complexity by around half, but at the cost of a corresponding increase in delay. Additional levels have diminishing returns, highlighting a tradeoff between complexity and delay. Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths. We then provide recommendations on which architecture to use for a given input length and implementation technology, based on which design factors -- such as complexity or delay -- are most important to the hardware designer. With this overview and analysis of various priority encoder architectures, we provide a priority encoder toolkit to assist hardware designers in creating the most optimal design."}

As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x."}

To reduce data movement, we use key-only transfer (keys and pointers) with late materialization. We further introduce a Risky Gate (risk-aware gating) that triggers offloading only in gain/risk intervals based on input size, transfer, kernel and post-processing costs, and candidate-set complexity (K, M).

While techniques such as quantization and pruning help mitigate this issue, selective token attention offers a promising alternative by narrowing the attention scope to only the most relevant tokens, reducing computation and filtering out noise.\n  In this work, we propose SATA, a locality-centric dynamic scheduling scheme that proactively manages sparsely distributed access patterns from selective Query-Key operations. By reordering operand flow and exploiting data locality, our approach enables early fetch and retirement of intermediate Query/Key vectors, improving system utilization. We implement and evaluate our token management strategy in a control and compute system, using runtime traces from selective-attention-based models. Experimental results show that our method improves system throughput by up to 1.76x and boosts energy efficiency by 2.94x, while incurring minimal scheduling overhead."}
