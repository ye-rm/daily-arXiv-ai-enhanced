Ising machines implemented using dynamical, digital and compute-in-memory (CiM) approaches offer a promising alternative, but often suffer from poor initialization and a fundamental trade-off between algorithmic performance and hardware efficiency. Hardware-friendly schemes such as simulated annealing converge slowly, whereas faster algorithms, including simulated bifurcation, are difficult to implement efficiently in CiM hardware, limiting both convergence speed and solution quality. To address these limitations, here we present a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based CiM Ising framework that tightly co-designs algorithms and hardware to efficiently solve large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed approach employs a two-step algorithmic flow: an attention-inspired initialization that exploits global spin topology and reduces the required iterations by up to 80%, followed by a lightweight simulated bifurcation algorithm specifically tailored for CiM implementation. To natively accelerate the core vector-matrix and vector-matrix-vector operations in both steps, we fabricate a 32x256 FeFET CiM chip using ferroelectric capacitors integrated at the back end of line of a 180-nm CMOS platform. Across Max-Cut instances with up to 100,000 nodes, the proposed hardware-software co-designed solver achieves up to a 175.9x speedup over a GPU-based simulated bifurcation implementation while consistently delivering superior solution quality."}

Achieving low latency necessitates codes with short blocklengths for which polar codes with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding typically outperform message-passing (MP)-based decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. However, SCL decoders are known to exhibit high latency and poor area efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new short-blocklength multi-rate binary LDPC code that outperforms the 5G-LDPC code for the same blocklength and is suitable for URLLC applications using fully parallel MP.

However, existing research focuses primarily on kernel-level optimizations, lacking a holistic serving framework that addresses the unique memory dynamics of diffusion processes in production. We identify a critical \"memory footprint crisis\" specific to dLLMs, driven by monolithic logit tensors and the severe resource oscillation between compute-bound \"Refresh\" phases and bandwidth-bound \"Reuse\" phases. To bridge this gap, we present dLLM-Serve, an efficient dLLM serving system that co-optimizes memory footprint, computational scheduling, and generation quality. dLLM-Serve introduces Logit-Aware Activation Budgeting to decompose transient tensor peaks, a Phase-Multiplexed Scheduler to interleave heterogeneous request phases, and Head-Centric Sparse Attention to decouple logical sparsity from physical storage. We evaluate dLLM-Serve on diverse workloads (LiveBench, Burst, OSC) and GPUs (RTX 4090, L40S). Relative to the state-of-the-art baseline, dLLM-Serve improves throughput by 1.61$\\times$-1.81$\\times$ on the consumer-grade RTX 4090 and 1.60$\\times$-1.74$\\times$ on the server-grade NVIDIA L40S, while reducing tail latency by nearly 4$\\times$ under heavy contention. dLLM-Serve establishes the first blueprint for scalable dLLM inference, converting theoretical algorithmic sparsity into tangible wall-clock acceleration across heterogeneous hardware."}

While these stages enhance capability, they introduce significant system bottlenecks. First, multimodal preprocessing-especially video decoding-often dominates Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). Most systems rely on CPU-based decoding, which severely limits throughput, while existing GPU-based approaches prioritize throughput-oriented parallelism and fail to meet the latency-sensitive requirements of MLLM inference. Second, the vision encoder is a standalone, compute-intensive stage that produces visual embeddings and cannot be co-batched with LLM prefill or decoding. This heterogeneity forces inter-stage blocking and increases token-generation latency. Even when deployed on separate GPUs, these stages underutilize available compute and memory resources, reducing overall utilization and constraining system throughput.\n  To address these challenges, we present FlashCodec and UnifiedServe, two complementary designs that jointly optimize the end-to-end MLLM pipeline. FlashCodec accelerates the multimodal preprocessing stage through collaborative multi-GPU video decoding, reducing decoding latency while preserving high throughput. UnifiedServe optimizes the vision-to-text and inference stages using a logically decoupled their execution to eliminate inter-stage blocking, yet physically sharing GPU resources to maximize GPU system utilization. By carefully orchestrating execution across stages and minimizing interference, UnifiedServe Together, our proposed framework forms an end-to-end optimized stack that can serve up to 3.0$\\times$ more requests or enforce 1.5$\\times$ tighter SLOs, while achieving up to 4.4$\\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems."}
