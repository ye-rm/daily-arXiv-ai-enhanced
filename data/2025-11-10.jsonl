Altering a PCM cell's state during writes demands substantial\nenergy, posing a significant challenge to PCM's role as the primary main\nmemory. Prior research has explored methods to reduce write energy consumption,\nincluding the elimination of redundant writes, minimizing cell writes, and\nemploying compact row buffers for filtering PCM main memory accesses. However,\nthese techniques had certain drawbacks like bit-wise comparison of the stored\nvalues, preemptive updates increasing write cycles, and poor endurance. In this\npaper, we propose WIRE, a new coding mechanism through which most write\noperations force a maximum of one-bit flip. In this coding-based data storage\nmethod, we look at the frequent value stack and assign a code word to the most\nfrequent values such that they have a hamming distance of one. In most of the\nwrite accesses, writing a value needs one or fewer bit flips which can save\nconsiderable write energy. This technique can be augmented with a wear-leveling\nmechanism at the block level, and rotating the difference bit in the assigned\ncodes, increasing the lifetime of the PCM array at a low cost. Using a\nfull-system evaluation of our method and comparing it to the existing\nmechanisms, our experimental results for multi-threaded and multi-programmed\nworkloads revealed considerable improvement in lifetime and write energy as\nwell as bit flip reduction."}

Phase-change memory (PCM) emerges as a\npromising candidate due to its scalability, fast access time, and zero leakage\npower compared to many existing memory technologies. However, PCM has\nsignificant drawbacks that currently hinder its viability as a replacement. PCM\ncells suffer from a limited lifespan because write operations degrade the\nphysical material, and these operations consume a considerable amount of\nenergy. For PCM to be a practical option for data storage-which involves\nfrequent write operations-its cell endurance must be enhanced, and write energy\nmust be reduced. In this paper, we propose SMART-WRITE, a method that\nintegrates neural networks (NN) and reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically\noptimize write energy and improve performance. The NN model monitors real-time\noperating conditions and device characteristics to determine optimal write\nparameters, while the RL model dynamically adjusts these parameters to further\noptimize PCM's energy consumption. By continuously adjusting PCM write\nparameters based on real-time system conditions, SMART-WRITE reduces write\nenergy consumption by up to 63% and improves performance by up to 51% compared\nto the baseline and previous models."}

To address this, we introduce RAS, the Range Asymmetric\nNumeral System Acceleration System, a hardware architecture that integrates the\nrANS algorithm into a lossless compression pipeline and eliminates key\nbottlenecks. RAS couples an rANS core with a probabilistic generator, storing\ndistributions in BF16 format and converting them once into a fixed-point domain\nshared by a unified division/modulo datapath. A two-stage rANS update with\nbyte-level re-normalization reduces logic cost and memory traffic, while a\nprediction-guided decoding path speculatively narrows the cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF) search window and safely falls back to maintain\nbit-exactness. A multi-lane organization scales throughput and enables\nfine-grained clock gating for efficient scheduling. On image workloads, our\nRTL-simulated prototype achieves 121.2x encode and 70.9x decode speedups over a\nPython rANS baseline, reducing average decoder binary-search steps from 7.00 to\n3.15 (approximately 55% fewer).
