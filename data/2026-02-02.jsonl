However, existing research in this domain faces two significant limitations. First, most methods are confined to single-task prediction, failing to capture the interconnected, multi-faceted nature of urban environments where numerous indicators are deeply correlated. Second, the field lacks a standardized experimental benchmark, which severely impedes fair comparison and reproducible progress. To address these challenges, we first establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-task urban region profiling, featuring multi-modal features and a diverse set of strong baselines to ensure a fair and rigorous evaluation environment. Concurrently, we propose UrbanMoE, the first sparse multi-modal, multi-expert framework specifically architected to solve the multi-task challenge. Leveraging a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, it dynamically routes multi-modal features to specialized sub-networks, enabling the simultaneous prediction of diverse urban indicators. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets within our benchmark, where UrbanMoE consistently demonstrates superior performance over all baselines. Further in-depth analysis validates the efficacy and efficiency of our approach, setting a new state-of-the-art and providing the community with a valuable tool for future research in urban analytics"}

LLM-based multi-agent systems mitigate the inefficiency of single agents in complex tasks. However, they still suffer from issues such as memory inconsistency and agent behavioral conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MiTa, a hierarchical memory-integrated task allocative framework to enhance collaborative efficiency. MiTa organizes agents into a manager-member hierarchy, where the manager incorporates additional allocation and summary modules that enable (1) global task allocation and (2) episodic memory integration. The allocation module enables the manager to allocate tasks from a global perspective, thereby avoiding potential inter-agent conflicts. The summary module, triggered by task progress updates, performs episodic memory integration by condensing recent collaboration history into a concise summary that preserves long-horizon context. By combining task allocation with episodic memory, MiTa attains a clearer understanding of the task and facilitates globally consistent task distribution. Experimental results confirm that MiTa achieves superior efficiency and adaptability in complex multi-agent cooperation over strong baseline methods."}

Consequently, directly generating AscendC kernels with LLMs yields extremely low correctness, highlighting a substantial gap between GPU and NPU kernel generation.\n  We present AscendCraft, a DSL-guided approach for automatic AscendC kernel generation. AscendCraft introduces a lightweight DSL that abstracts non-essential complexity while explicitly modeling Ascend-specific execution semantics. Kernels are first generated in the DSL using category-specific expert examples and then transcompiled into AscendC through structured, constraint-driven LLM lowering passes. Evaluated on MultiKernelBench across seven operator categories, AscendCraft achieves 98.1% compilation success and 90.4% functional correctness. Moreover, 46.2% of generated kernels match or exceed PyTorch eager execution performance, demonstrating that DSL-guided transcompilation can enable LLMs to generate both correct and competitive NPU kernels. Beyond benchmarks, AscendCraft further demonstrates its generality by successfully generating two correct kernels for newly proposed mHC architecture, achieving performance that substantially surpasses PyTorch eager execution."}

KevlarFlow leverages 1) decoupled model parallelism initialization, 2) dynamic traffic rerouting, and 3) background KV cache replication to maintain high throughput during partial failures. Our evaluation demonstrates that KevlarFlow reduces mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by 20x and, under failure conditions, improves average latency by 3.1x, 99th percentile (p99) latency by 2.8x, average time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 378.9x, and p99 TTFT by 574.6x with negligible runtime overhead in comparison to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems."}

With the scaling of technology nodes, in floorplanning stage especially 3D scenarios with multiple stacked layers, it has become increasingly challenging to adhere to complex hardware design rules. Current methods are only capable of handling specific and limited design rules, while violations of other rules require manual and meticulous adjustment. This leads to labor-intensive and time-consuming post-processing for expert engineers. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one deep reinforcement learning-based approach to tackle these challenges, and design novel representations for real-world IC design rules that have not been addressed by previous approaches. Specifically, the processing of various hardware design rules is unified into a single framework with three key components: 1) novel matrix representations to model the design rules, 2) constraints on the action space to filter out invalid actions that cause rule violations, and 3) quantitative analysis of constraint satisfaction as reward signals. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and validity of our approach. Furthermore, transferability is well demonstrated on unseen circuits. Our framework is extensible to accommodate new design rules, thus providing flexibility to address emerging challenges in future chip design.

The shift to renewable energy and growing data center energy demands can destabilize the power grid. Power grids rely on frequency regulation reserves, typically fossil-fueled power plants, to stabilize and balance the supply and demand of electricity. This paper sheds light on the hidden carbon emissions of frequency regulation service. Our work explores how modern GPU data centers can coordinate with power grids to reduce the need for fossil-fueled frequency regulation reserves. We first introduce a novel metric, Exogenous Carbon, to quantify grid-side carbon emission reductions resulting from data center participation in regulation service. We additionally introduce EcoCenter, a framework to maximize the amount of frequency regulation provision that GPU data centers can provide, and thus, reduce the amount of frequency regulation reserves necessary. We demonstrate that data center participation in frequency regulation can result in Exogenous carbon savings that oftentimes outweigh Operational carbon emissions."}

While previous works focused on CPUs, this work extends the concept of heterogeneity to GPUs by proposing KHEPRI, a heterogeneous GPU architecture for graphics applications. Scenes in graphics applications showcase diversity, as they consist of many objects with varying levels of complexity. As a result, computational intensity and memory bandwidth requirements differ significantly across different regions of each scene. To address this variability, our proposal includes two types of cores: cores optimized for high ILP (compute-specialized) and cores that tolerate a higher number of simultaneously outstanding cache misses (memory-specialized). A key component of the proposed architecture is a novel work scheduler that dynamically assigns each part of a frame (i.e., a tile) to the most suitable core. Designing this scheduler is particularly challenging, as it must preserve data locality; otherwise, the benefits of heterogeneity may be offset by the penalty of additional cache misses. Additionally, the scheduler requires knowledge of each tile's characteristics before rendering it. For this purpose, KHEPRI leverages frame-to-frame coherence to predict the behavior of each tile based on that of the corresponding tile in the previous frame. Evaluations across a wide range of commercial animated graphics applications show that, compared to a traditional homogeneous GPU, KHEPRI achieves an average performance improvement of 9.2%, a throughput increase (frames per second) of 7.3%, and a total GPU energy reduction of 4.8%. Importantly, these benefits are achieved without any hardware overhead."}

HetCCL introduces two novel mechanisms that enable cross-vendor communication while leveraging optimized vendor libraries, NVIDIA NCCL and AMD RCCL.

We identify this phenomenon as middle-phase thrashing, a previously under-characterized pathology in which cache efficiency collapses as long-lived agents accumulate state over time.\n  We argue that mitigating this pathology requires moving beyond reactive, request-level cache management to proactive, agent-level admission control. Drawing inspiration from congestion control in distributed systems, we view the KV cache as a shared resource whose efficient utilization depends on feedback-driven regulation. Based on this insight, we present CONCUR, a lightweight control layer that regulates agent admission to bound aggregate cache pressure while preserving execution continuity. CONCUR adapts a cache-aware control algorithm to dynamically adjust the number of active agents using runtime cache signals.\n  Across large models and real-world agent workloads, CONCUR prevents middle-phase thrashing and improves batch inference throughput by up to 4.09x on Qwen3-32B and 1.9x on DeepSeek-V3, while remaining compatible with existing LLM serving systems."}

By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel. As a result, an external arbiter is required to arbitrate an immutable happens-before relation between concurrent events. Arbitration occurs asynchronously in batches via optional ''epoch events'', preserving availability. This introduces a bounded total order within epochs, and the resulting ''finality'' improves on the level of consistency CRDTs can provide."}
