*Laslo Hunhold*

Main category: cs.ET

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite recent hardware advances, real arithmetic in balanced ternary logic has been largely overlooked despite its promising properties for energy-efficient computing and overcoming memory wall limitations. The paper aims to fill this gap by developing a ternary-specific number format.

Method: The paper revisits tapered precision arithmetic concepts from posit and takum formats and introduces tekum arithmetic specifically designed for balanced ternary logic. It addresses fundamental design challenges in creating this new ternary number format.

Result: The proposed tekum format exhibits highly promising characteristics and outperforms both posits and takums in many respects. The evaluation shows it represents a crucial advancement for ternary real-number computation.

Conclusion: This work lays the groundwork for a new class of number formats designed specifically for next-generation ternary hardware, unlocking the full potential of real-number computation in ternary systems as ternary hardware matures.

Abstract: In light of recent hardware advances, it is striking that real arithmetic in balanced ternary logic has received almost no attention in the literature. This is particularly surprising given ternary logic's promising properties, which could open new avenues for energy-efficient computing and offer novel strategies for overcoming the memory wall.
  This paper revisits the concept of tapered precision arithmetic, as used in posit and takum formats, and introduces a new scheme for balanced ternary logic: tekum arithmetic. Several fundamental design challenges are addressed along the way. The proposed format is evaluated and shown to exhibit highly promising characteristics. In many respects, it outperforms both posits and takums. As ternary hardware matures, this work represents a crucial step toward unlocking the full potential of real-number computation in ternary systems, laying the groundwork for a new class of number formats designed from the ground up for a new category of next-generation hardware.

### [2] [Beyond Memristor: Neuromorphic Computing Using Meminductor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11002)
*Frank Zhigang Wang*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: Researchers discovered that a coil with magnetic core acts as a meminductor (inductor with memory), where inductance depends on charge history, enabling new neuromorphic computing applications beyond memristors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore memory elements beyond memristors for novel computing architectures, particularly for neuromorphic computing, deep learning, and brain-inspired systems where inductance plays a crucial role in circuit time constants.

Method: Identified that a coil with magnetic core functions as a meminductor with inductance L(q) dependent on charge q, where magnetization history in the core remembers current patterns. Experimentally verified by reproducing biological behavior of amoebae using the meminductor.

Result: Successfully demonstrated that magnetic-core coils act as meminductors with memory capabilities. Experimental verification showed the meminductor could reproduce amoebae's memorizing, timing, and anticipating biological behaviors.

Conclusion: A beyond-memristor computing paradigm using meminductors is both theoretically sensible and experimentally practical, offering unique capabilities for neuromorphic computing that memristors alone cannot provide.

Abstract: Memristor (resistor with memory), inductor with memory (meminductor) and capacitor with memory (memcapacitor) have different roles to play in novel computing architectures. We found that a coil with a magnetic core is an inductor with memory (meminductor) in terms of its inductance L(q) being a function of the charge q. The history of the current passing through the coil is remembered by the magnetization inside the magnetic core. Such a meminductor can play a unique role (that cannot be played by a memristor) in neuromorphic computing, deep learning and brain inspired since the time constant of a neuromorphic RLC circuit is jointly determined by the inductance and capacitance, rather than the resistance. As an experimental verification, this newly invented meminductor was used to reproduce the observed biological behaviour of amoebae (the memorizing, timing and anticipating mechanisms). In conclusion, a beyond memristor computing paradigm is theoretically sensible and experimentally practical.

### [3] [An Efficient Approach for Energy Conservation in Cloud Computing Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10974)
*Sohan Kumar Pande,Sanjaya Kumar Panda,Preeti Ranjan Sahu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Proposed task scheduling algorithm improves energy efficiency in cloud services by explicitly optimizing CPU, disk, and I/O resource utilization through a fitness function, outperforming existing MaxUtil algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud services consume significant energy, and current energy sources are limited with environmental impact. Existing scheduling algorithms focus on maximizing average resource utilization or minimizing makespan but ignore different resource types (CPU, disk, I/O) in physical machines.

Method: Developed a task scheduling algorithm using a fitness value function that considers CPU, disk, I/O utilization, and task processing time to explicitly improve resource utilization and increase active resource utilization.

Result: Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets show the proposed algorithm outperforms existing MaxUtil algorithm in energy efficiency, consuming less energy while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: The proposed task scheduling algorithm successfully addresses energy efficiency in cloud services by explicitly optimizing multiple resource types, demonstrating better energy performance than existing approaches and contributing to sustainable cloud computing.

Abstract: Recent trends of technology have explored a numerous applications of cloud services, which require a significant amount of energy. In the present scenario, most of the energy sources are limited and have a greenhouse effect on the environment. Therefore, it is the need of the hour that the energy consumed by the cloud service providers must be reduced and it is a great challenge to the research community to develop energy-efficient algorithms. To design the same, some researchers tried to maximize the average resource utilization, whereas some researchers tried to minimize the makespan. However, they have not considered different types of resources that are present in the physical machines. In this paper, we propose a task scheduling algorithm, which tries to improve utilization of resources (like CPU, disk, I/O) explicitly, which in turn increases the utilization of active resources. For this, the proposed algorithm uses a fitness value, which is a function of CPU, disk and I/O utilization, and processing time of the task. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive simulations are performed on both proposed algorithm and existing algorithm MaxUtil using synthetic datasets. From the simulation results, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is a better energy-efficient algorithm and consumes less energy than the MaxUtil algorithm.

Abstract: Live migration, a technology enabling seamless transition of operational computational entities between various hosts while preserving continuous functionality and client connectivity, has been the subject of extensive research. However, existing reviews often overlook critical technical aspects and practical challenges integral to the usage of live migration techniques in real-world scenarios. This work bridges this gap by integrating the aspects explored in existing reviews together with a comprehensive analysis of live migration technologies across multiple dimensions, with focus on migration techniques, migration units, and infrastructure characteristics. Despite efforts to make live migration widely accessible, its reliance on multiple system factors can create challenges. In certain cases, the complexities and resource demands outweigh the benefits, making its implementation hard to justify. The focus of this work is mainly on container based and virtual machine-based migration technologies, examining the current state of the art and the disparity in adoption between these two approaches. Furthermore, this work explores the impact of migration objectives and operational constraints on the usability and efficacy of existing technologies. By outlining current technical challenges and providing guidelines for future research and development directions, this work serves a dual purpose: first, to equip enthusiasts with a valuable resource on live migration, and second, to contribute to the advancement of live migration technologies and their practical implementation across diverse computing environments.

### [6] [Reducing Fragmentation and Starvation in GPU Clusters through Dynamic Multi-Objective Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10980)
*Akhmadillo Mamirov*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Dynamic schedulers (HPS, PBS, SBS) significantly outperform static policies in GPU cluster utilization, throughput, and fairness for AI workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU clusters suffer from low average utilization (~50%) due to fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and limitations of static scheduling policies in AI deployment environments.

Method: Three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS), evaluated using controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster with realistic training, inference, and research workloads.

Result: HPS achieved highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs/hour), lowest fairness variance (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS reached 76.1% utilization, SBS reached 74.6%. Static baselines achieved only 45-67% utilization with severe starvation (up to 156 jobs waiting >30 minutes).

Conclusion: Dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics across all key metrics, demonstrating that targeted scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters.

Abstract: GPU clusters have become essential for training and deploying modern AI systems, yet real deployments continue to report average utilization near 50%. This inefficiency is largely caused by fragmentation, heterogeneous workloads, and the limitations of static scheduling policies. This work presents a systematic evaluation of these issues and introduces three specialized dynamic schedulers: Hybrid Priority (HPS), Predictive Backfill (PBS), and Smart Batch (SBS). These schedulers are designed to improve utilization, fairness, and overall throughput in multi-tenant GPU clusters. We evaluate all schedulers using a controlled simulation of 1,000 AI jobs on a 64-GPU, 8-node cluster that includes a realistic mix of training, inference, and research workloads. Static baselines (FIFO, SJF, Shortest, Shortest-GPU) achieve 45 to 67% GPU utilization and 12.5 to 18.3 jobs per hour and experience severe starvation, with as many as 156 jobs waiting longer than 30 minutes. The dynamic schedulers significantly outperform these policies. HPS achieves the highest utilization (78.2%), highest throughput (25.8 jobs per hour), and the lowest fairness variance among dynamic methods (457), reducing starvation to 12 jobs. PBS improves fragmentation handling and reaches 76.1% utilization, while SBS increases efficiency for structurally similar jobs and reaches 74.6% utilization. Across all key metrics, including throughput, job wait times, fairness variance, and starvation, dynamic multi-objective schedulers consistently outperform single-objective heuristics. These results show that targeted and transparent scheduling strategies can meaningfully increase GPU efficiency in heterogeneous AI clusters and provide a practical foundation for future production scheduling frameworks.

### [8] [Dora: QoE-Aware Hybrid Parallelism for Distributed Edge AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10990)
*Jianli Jin,Ziyang Lin,Qianli Dong,Yi Chen,Jayanth Srinivasa,Myungjin Lee,Zhaowei Tan,Fan Lai*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Dora is a framework for QoE-aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI that optimizes computation, networks, and QoE objectives to achieve faster execution and energy savings while maintaining quality of experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge AI applications need to satisfy user QoE requirements like inference latency while operating in resource-constrained settings. Current planners for hybrid parallelism optimize for throughput or device utilization but overlook QoE, leading to resource inefficiency and QoE violations under runtime dynamics.

Method: Dora uses three key mechanisms: (1) heterogeneity-aware model partitioner that assigns model partitions across devices to create QoE-compliant plans, (2) contention-aware network scheduler that refines plans by maximizing compute-communication overlap, and (3) runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting QoEs.

Result: Across representative edge deployments (smart homes, traffic analytics, small edge clusters), Dora achieves 1.1-6.3× faster execution and reduces energy consumption by 21-82%, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.

Conclusion: Dora effectively addresses the challenge of QoE-aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI by jointly optimizing heterogeneous computation, contention-prone networks, and multi-dimensional QoE objectives, achieving significant performance improvements and energy savings.

Abstract: With the proliferation of edge AI applications, satisfying user quality of experience (QoE) requirements, such as model inference latency, has become a first class objective, as these models operate in resource constrained settings and directly interact with users. Yet, modern AI models routinely exceed the resource capacity of individual devices, necessitating distributed execution across heterogeneous devices over variable and contention prone networks. Existing planners for hybrid (e.g., data and pipeline) parallelism largely optimize for throughput or device utilization, overlooking QoE, leading to severe resource inefficiency (e.g., unnecessary energy drain) or QoE violations under runtime dynamics.
  We present Dora, a framework for QoE aware hybrid parallelism in distributed edge AI training and inference. Dora jointly optimizes heterogeneous computation, contention prone networks, and multi dimensional QoE objectives via three key mechanisms: (i) a heterogeneity aware model partitioner that determines and assigns model partitions across devices, forming a compact set of QoE compliant plans; (ii) a contention aware network scheduler that further refines these candidate plans by maximizing compute communication overlap; and (iii) a runtime adapter that adaptively composes multiple plans to maximize global efficiency while respecting overall QoEs. Across representative edge deployments, including smart homes, traffic analytics, and small edge clusters, Dora achieves 1.1--6.3 times faster execution and, alternatively, reduces energy consumption by 21--82 percent, all while maintaining QoE under runtime dynamics.

*Adilet Metinov,Gulida M. Kudakeeva,Gulnara D. Kabaeva*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: GPU-native compilation eliminates CPU-GPU data transfer bottlenecks, offering 10-100x speedups for AI code generation through three approaches: parallel traditional compilation, neural compilation with probabilistic verification, and hybrid architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI code generation systems suffer from significant latency bottlenecks due to CPU-GPU data transfers during compilation, execution, and testing phases, which slows down code iteration cycles.

Method: Three complementary GPU-native compilation approaches: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness.

Conclusion: GPU-native compilation can dramatically accelerate AI code generation, with formalized probabilistic verification enabling accuracy-parallelism tradeoffs, and implications for self-improving AI systems and future analog computing substrates.

Abstract: Current AI code generation systems suffer from significant latency bottlenecks due to CPU-GPU data transfers during compilation, execution, and testing phases. We establish theoretical foundations for three complementary approaches to GPU-native compilation that eliminate these transfers: (1) parallel traditional compilation adapted for GPU execution, (2) neural compilation using learned sequence-to-sequence translation with probabilistic verification, and (3) hybrid architectures combining both strategies. We derive latency and energy bounds demonstrating potential speedups of 10-100x for code iteration cycles. Our analysis shows that traditional GPU compilation provides 2-5x improvements through transfer elimination, neural compilation achieves 10-100x speedups via massive parallelism, and hybrid approaches offer practical deployment paths with guaranteed correctness. We formalize the probabilistic verification framework that enables trading compilation accuracy for parallel exploration, and discuss implications for self-improving AI systems and future analog computing substrates.

### [10] [RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306)
*Tianyuan Wu,Lunxi Cao,Yining Wei,Wei Gao,Yuheng Zhao,Dakai An,Shaopan Xiong,Zhiqiang Lv,Ju Huang,Siran Yang,Yinghao Yu,Jiamang Wang,Lin Qu,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: RollMux is a cluster scheduling framework that improves efficiency in rollout-training disaggregated RL systems by eliminating dependency bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration and co-execution groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rollout-training disaggregation in RL systems creates dependency bubbles where one cluster idles while waiting for the other, reducing hardware efficiency despite being the standard architecture for maximizing efficiency.

Method: Introduces co-execution group abstraction for cluster partitioning, enabling two-tier scheduling: inter-group scheduler for job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and intra-group scheduler with provably optimal round-robin scheduling. Maintains residency constraint for warm-start context switching.

Result: Achieves 1.84x cost efficiency improvement over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, with 100% SLO attainment on production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs.

Conclusion: RollMux effectively reclaims dependency bubbles in RL rollout-training disaggregation through intelligent cluster scheduling, significantly improving hardware efficiency while maintaining service level objectives.

Abstract: Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.

*Patrick D. Manya,Eugene M. Mbuyi,Gothy T. Ngoie,Jordan F. Masakuna*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Enhanced distributed pruning method for closeness centrality using multi-packet messaging to reduce communication overhead in large networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed approximation techniques for closeness centrality computation suffer from high communication overhead and fail to fully mitigate data packet exchange costs in large network settings.

Method: Introduces a novel enhancement to distributed pruning method using multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger consolidated data blocks to reduce message count and minimize data loss.

Result: Multi-packet approach substantially outperforms original pruning technique in message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time while preserving approximation accuracy. Shows manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead.

Conclusion: The enhanced method offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, representing a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.

Abstract: Identifying central nodes using closeness centrality is a critical task in analyzing large-scale complex networks, yet its decentralized computation remains challenging due to high communication overhead. Existing distributed approximation techniques, such as pruning, often fail to fully mitigate the cost of exchanging numerous data packets in large network settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel enhancement to the distributed pruning method specifically designed to overcome this communication bottleneck. Our core contribution is a technique that leverages multi-packet messaging, allowing nodes to batch and transmit larger, consolidated data blocks. This approach significantly reduces the number of exchanged messages and minimizes data loss without compromising the accuracy of the centrality estimates. We demonstrate that our multi-packet approach substantially outperforms the original pruning technique in both message efficiency (fewer overall messages) and computation time, preserving the core approximation properties of the baseline method. While we observe a manageable trade-off in increased per-node memory usage and local overhead, our findings show that this is outweighed by the gains in communication efficiency, particularly for very large networks and complex packet structures. Our work offers a more scalable and efficient solution for decentralized closeness centrality computation, promising a significant step forward for large-scale network analysis.

### [12] [Parallax: Runtime Parallelization for Operator Fallbacks in Heterogeneous Edge Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11532)
*Chong Tang,Hao Dai,Jagmohan Chauhan*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Parallax is a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference by intelligently handling CPU fallbacks, using branch-aware memory management and adaptive scheduling to reduce latency and memory overhead without requiring model refactoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time DNN applications on edge devices need faster inference for complex models, but existing frameworks handle CPU fallbacks poorly when specialized accelerators can't process dynamic control-flow operators or unsupported kernels, leading to idle CPU cores, high latency, and memory spikes.

Method: Parallax partitions computation DAGs to expose parallelism, uses branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint, employs adaptive scheduling based on device memory constraints, and enables fine-grained subgraph control for heterogeneous inference of dynamic models.

Result: Evaluation on five representative DNNs across three mobile devices shows up to 46% latency reduction, controlled memory overhead (26.5% average), and up to 30% energy savings compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: Parallax effectively addresses mobile DNN inference bottlenecks by optimizing CPU fallback handling, delivering significant performance improvements aligned with real-time mobile inference demands without requiring model modifications.

Abstract: The growing demand for real-time DNN applications on edge devices necessitates faster inference of increasingly complex models. Although many devices include specialized accelerators (e.g., mobile GPUs), dynamic control-flow operators and unsupported kernels often fall back to CPU execution. Existing frameworks handle these fallbacks poorly, leaving CPU cores idle and causing high latency and memory spikes. We introduce Parallax, a framework that accelerates mobile DNN inference without model refactoring or custom operator implementations. Parallax first partitions the computation DAG to expose parallelism, then employs branch-aware memory management with dedicated arenas and buffer reuse to reduce runtime footprint. An adaptive scheduler executes branches according to device memory constraints, meanwhile, fine-grained subgraph control enables heterogeneous inference of dynamic models. By evaluating on five representative DNNs across three different mobile devices, Parallax achieves up to 46% latency reduction, maintains controlled memory overhead (26.5% on average), and delivers up to 30% energy savings compared with state-of-the-art frameworks, offering improvements aligned with the responsiveness demands of real-time mobile inference.

### [14] [Stateless Snowflake: A Cloud-Agnostic Distributed ID Generator Using Network-Derived Identity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11643)
*Manideep Reddy Chinthareddy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates worker ID coordination by deriving uniqueness from container IP addresses, enabling stateless scaling in Kubernetes environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Snowflake-style ID generators require manual worker ID assignment or central coordination, which creates operational friction in modern container-orchestrated environments where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. This conflicts with the stateless nature of microservices.

Method: Proposes a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates explicit worker IDs by deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties (container's private IPv4 address). Uses a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity.

Result: Validated across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. While theoretical single-node ceiling is ~64,000 TPS, practical microservice deployments show network I/O dominates latency, resulting in ~31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster. Performance is comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully eliminates the need for centralized coordination in distributed ID generation, making it suitable for modern containerized environments while maintaining performance comparable to traditional approaches and enabling true stateless scaling.

Abstract: Snowflake-style distributed ID generators are the industry standard for producing k-ordered, unique identifiers at scale. However, the traditional requirement for manually assigned or centrally coordinated worker IDs introduces significant friction in modern container-orchestrated environments (e.g., Kubernetes), where workloads are ephemeral and autoscaled. In such systems, maintaining stable worker identities requires complex stateful sets or external coordination services (e.g., ZooKeeper), negating the operational benefits of stateless microservices.
  This paper presents a cloud-agnostic, container-native ID generation protocol that eliminates the dependency on explicit worker IDs. By deriving node uniqueness deterministically from ephemeral network properties - specifically the container's private IPv4 address - the proposed method removes the need for centralized coordination. We introduce a modified bit-allocation scheme (1-41-16-6) that accommodates 16 bits of network-derived entropy while preserving strict monotonicity. We validate the approach across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Evaluation results demonstrate that while the design has a theoretical single-node ceiling of approximately 64,000 TPS, in practical microservice deployments the network I/O dominates latency, resulting in end-to-end performance (approximately 31,000 TPS on a 3-node cluster) comparable to classic stateful generators while offering effectively unbounded horizontal scalability.

TL;DR: ECCO is a video analytics framework that reduces compute/communication costs by grouping cameras with similar data drift patterns and training shared models instead of individual models per camera.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video analytics systems retrain separate DNN models for each camera to handle real-time data drift, but this approach has high compute and communication costs that make it unscalable for large deployments.

Method: ECCO uses: 1) lightweight grouping algorithm to dynamically form/update camera groups based on similar drift patterns; 2) GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across groups for accuracy and fairness; 3) transmission controller at each camera for frame sampling and bandwidth coordination.

Result: ECCO improves retraining accuracy by 6.7%-18.1% using same resources, or supports 3.3 times more concurrent cameras at same accuracy, evaluated on three datasets for two vision tasks.

Conclusion: ECCO provides a resource-efficient continuous learning framework for video analytics by exploiting spatial-temporal correlations in data drift across cameras, making large-scale deployments more practical and scalable.

Abstract: Recent advances in video analytics address real-time data drift by continuously retraining specialized, lightweight DNN models for individual cameras. However, the current practice of retraining a separate model for each camera suffers from high compute and communication costs, making it unscalable. We present ECCO, a new video analytics framework designed for resource-efficient continuous learning. The key insight is that the data drift, which necessitates model retraining, often shows temporal and spatial correlations across nearby cameras. By identifying cameras that experience similar drift and retraining a shared model for them, ECCO can substantially reduce the associated compute and communication costs. Specifically, ECCO introduces: (i) a lightweight grouping algorithm that dynamically forms and updates camera groups; (ii) a GPU allocator that dynamically assigns GPU resources across different groups to improve retraining accuracy and ensure fairness; and (iii) a transmission controller at each camera that configures frame sampling and coordinates bandwidth sharing with other cameras based on its assigned GPU resources. We conducted extensive evaluations on three distinctive datasets for two vision tasks. Compared to leading baselines, ECCO improves retraining accuracy by 6.7%-18.1% using the same compute and communication resources, or supports 3.3 times more concurrent cameras at the same accuracy.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: H-MPCs use hypergraph-based multi-party channels to solve liquidity fragmentation and channel depletion in payment networks, achieving 94% transaction success rate without HTLC failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public blockchains have low throughput and high latency, requiring off-chain solutions like PCNs. Existing PCNs suffer from liquidity fragmentation (locked funds can't be reused elsewhere) and channel depletion, limiting routing efficiency and transaction success rates. Multi-party channels help but create single points of failure with leaders/coordinators.

Method: Introduces Hypergraph-based Multi-Party Payment Channels (H-MPCs) that replace bilateral channels with collectively funded hyperedges. Enables fully concurrent, leaderless intra- and inter-hyperedge payments through verifiable, proposer-ordered DAG updates.

Result: Implementation on a 150-node network demonstrates approximately 94% transaction success rate without HTLC expiry or routing failures, showing robustness of H-MPCs.

Conclusion: H-MPCs offer significantly greater flexibility and concurrency than prior designs by addressing liquidity fragmentation and channel depletion issues while eliminating single points of failure through leaderless architecture.

Abstract: Public blockchains inherently offer low throughput and high latency, motivating off-chain scalability solutions such as Payment Channel Networks (PCNs). However, existing PCNs suffer from liquidity fragmentation-funds locked in one channel cannot be reused elsewhere-and channel depletion, both of which limit routing efficiency and reduce transaction success rates. Multi-party channel (MPC) constructions mitigate these issues, but they typically rely on leaders or coordinators, creating single points of failure and providing only limited flexibility for inter-channel payments.
  We introduce Hypergraph-based Multi-Party Payment Channels (H-MPCs), a new off-chain construction that replaces bilateral channels with collectively funded hyperedges. These hyperedges enable fully concurrent, leaderless intra- and inter-hyperedge payments through verifiable, proposer-ordered DAG updates, offering significantly greater flexibility and concurrency than prior designs.
  Our implementation on a 150-node network demonstrates a transaction success rate of approximately 94% without HTLC expiry or routing failures, highlighting the robustness of H-MPCs.

### [17] [PD-Swap: Prefill-Decode Logic Swapping for End-to-End LLM Inference on Edge FPGAs via Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11550)
*Yifan Zhang,Zhiheng Chen,Ye Qiao,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: PD-Swap: A prefill-decode disaggregated LLM accelerator using Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration on FPGAs to optimize both compute-bound prefill and memory-bandwidth-bound decode phases separately, achieving up to 27 tokens/s decoding throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge FPGAs struggle with long-context LLM inference due to quadratic prefill costs and KV-cache bandwidth demands. Static accelerators must handle both compute-bound prefill and memory-bandwidth-bound decode phases inefficiently, leading to duplicated logic, underutilized resources, and limited context size.

Method: Proposes PD-Swap using Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration to time-multiplex attention modules. Core ternary matrix multiplication and weight buffering remain static, while attention subsystem has two phase-specialized architectures: token-parallel prefill engine and KV-cache-centric decode engine. Uses roofline model and design space exploration to optimize reconfigurable region size and parallelism.

Result: Achieves up to 27 tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art by 1.3x-2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths) without extra area cost.

Conclusion: Prefill-decode disaggregation via DPR effectively addresses the asymmetry between compute-bound prefill and memory-bandwidth-bound decode phases, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference on edge FPGAs with significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Aggressively quantized large language models (LLMs), such as BitNet-style 1.58-bit Transformers with ternary weights, make it feasible to deploy generative AI on low-power edge FPGAs. However, as prompts grow to tens of thousands of tokens, edge hardware performance drops sharply with sequence length due to quadratic prefill cost and rapidly increasing KV-cache bandwidth demands, making inference latency of longer context length a first-order system concern. Recent studies on LLMs expose a fundamental prefill-decode asymmetry: prefill is compute-bound and dominated by dense matrix-matrix operations, whereas decoding is memory-bandwidth-bound and dominated by KV-cache traffic. A static accelerator must provision resources and a single dataflow for both regimes, leading to duplicated attention logic, underutilized fabric, and tight LUT/URAM limits that cap model size and usable context. We propose a prefill--decode disaggregated LLM accelerator, PD-Swap, that uses Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to time-multiplex the attention module on edge FPGAs. The core table-lookup ternary matrix multiplication and weight-buffering engines remain static, while the attention subsystem is a reconfigurable partition with two phase-specialized architectures: a compute-heavy, token-parallel prefill engine and a bandwidth-optimized, KV-cache-centric decoding engine. A roofline-inspired model and design space exploration jointly optimize reconfigurable-region size, parallelism under reconfiguration and routability constraints, and reconfiguration latency is hidden by computation latency. PD-Swap achieves up to 27~tokens/s decoding throughput, outperforming prior state-of-the-art works by 1.3x--2.1x (larger gains at longer context lengths), without extra area cost.
