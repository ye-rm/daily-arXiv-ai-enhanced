First, we propose a precision-aware quantization framework that reduces DSP demand while preserving motion accuracy. This is also the first study to systematically evaluate quantization impact on robot control and motion for hardware acceleration. Second, we leverage a division deferring optimization in mass matrix inversion algorithm, which decouples reciprocal operations from the longest latency path to improve the performance. Finally, we present an inter-module DSP reuse methodology to improve DSP utilization and save DSP usage. Experiment results show that our work achieves up to 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction over state-of-the-art RBD accelerators across various robot types, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for high-DOF robotic systems."}

The recent Armv9 architecture introduces Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), enabling tile-based matrix operations with high throughput. However, effectively exploiting both SME and traditional SIMD resources for unstructured sparse workloads remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LOOPS, a hybrid execution framework that combines row-wise CSR-part with vector-wise BCSR-part layout, enabling cooperative utilization of vector instructions (NEON) and Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) resources. LOOPS supports multi-precision SpMM across FP64, FP32, and FP16 via an adaptive two-level parallelization scheme guided by a lightweight performance model. Experimental results on the entire SuiteSparse on an Apple's M4Pro CPU show that LOOPS achieves average speedups of 9.93$\\times$ (FP32)/14.4$\\times$ (FP64) against the CPU baseline TACO and 71.3$\\times$ (FP32)/54.8$\\times$ (FP64) with respect to Armadillo. A comparison of LOOPS running on the same CPU with two GPU methods (cuSPARSE, Magicube) executed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU show average speedups for LOOPS between 19.8$\\times$ and 33.5$\\times$, depending on the precision. Notably, LOOPS delivers significantly better energy efficiency than the GPU codes on the A100 GPU."}

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases."}
