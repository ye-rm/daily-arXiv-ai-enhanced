First, we propose a precision-aware quantization framework that reduces DSP demand while preserving motion accuracy. This is also the first study to systematically evaluate quantization impact on robot control and motion for hardware acceleration. Second, we leverage a division deferring optimization in mass matrix inversion algorithm, which decouples reciprocal operations from the longest latency path to improve the performance. Finally, we present an inter-module DSP reuse methodology to improve DSP utilization and save DSP usage. Experiment results show that our work achieves up to 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction over state-of-the-art RBD accelerators across various robot types, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for high-DOF robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "A hardware-efficient RBD accelerator using FPGA with three innovations: precision-aware quantization, division deferring optimization, and inter-module DSP reuse, achieving 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction.", "motivation": "To develop a more efficient RBD (Rigid Body Dynamics) accelerator for robotic systems that reduces hardware resource demands while maintaining motion accuracy and performance.", "method": "Three key innovations: 1) Precision-aware quantization framework to reduce DSP demand, 2) Division deferring optimization in mass matrix inversion to decouple reciprocal operations, 3) Inter-module DSP reuse methodology to improve DSP utilization.", "result": "Achieves up to 8x throughput improvement and 7.4x latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art RBD accelerators across various robot types.", "conclusion": "The proposed FPGA-based RBD accelerator demonstrates effectiveness and scalability for high-DOF robotic systems through hardware-efficient optimizations."}}

It asks for a distributed algorithm that brings the robots to a common location, not known in advance. We consider the case of robots constrained to move along the edges of a graph under the well-known OBLOT model. Gathering is then accomplished once all the robots occupy a same vertex. Differently from classical settings, we assume: i) the initial configuration may contain multiplicities, i.e. more than one robot may occupy the same vertex; ii) robots cannot detect multiplicities; iii) robots move along the edges of vertex- and edge-transitive graphs, i.e. graphs where all the vertices (and the edges, resp.) belong to a same class of equivalence. To balance somehow such a `hostile' setting, as a scheduler for the activation of the robots, we consider the round-robin, where robots are cyclically activated one at a time.\n  We provide some basic impossibility results and we design two different algorithms approaching the Gathering for robots moving on two specific topologies belonging to edge- and vertex-transitive graphs: infinite grids and hypercubes. The two algorithms are both time-optimal and heavily exploit the properties of the underlying topologies. Because of this, we conjecture that no general algorithm can exist for all the solvable cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper studies the Gathering problem for robots moving on vertex- and edge-transitive graphs under challenging conditions: initial multiplicities allowed, no multiplicity detection, and round-robin scheduling.
