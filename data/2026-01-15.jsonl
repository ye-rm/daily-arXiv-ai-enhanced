Here, we address this through graph sparsification with auxiliary copy variables and demonstrate a fully on-chip parallel tempering solver on an FPGA. Targeting MIMO detection, a dense, NP-hard problem central to wireless communications, we fit 15 temperature replicas of a 128-node sparsified system (1,920 p-bits) entirely on-chip and achieve bit error rates significantly below conventional linear detectors. We report complete end-to-end solution times of 4.7 ms per instance, with all loading, sampling, readout, and verification overheads included. ASIC projections in 7 nm technology indicate about 90 MHz operation with less than 200 mW power dissipation, suggesting that massive parallelism across multiple chips could approach the throughput demands of next-generation wireless systems. However, sparsification introduces sensitivity to the copy-constraint strength. Employing Two-Dimensional Parallel Tempering (2D-PT), which exchanges replicas across both temperature and constraint dimensions, we demonstrate over 10X faster convergence without manual parameter tuning. These results establish an on-chip p-bit architecture and a scalable algorithmic framework for dense combinatorial optimization."}

Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB."}

Once the prefill GPU completes its task, the KV cache must be transferred to the decode GPU. While existing works have proposed various KV cache transfer paths across different memory and storage tiers, there remains a lack of systematic benchmarking that compares their performance and energy efficiency. Meanwhile, although optimization techniques such as KV cache reuse and frequency scaling have been utilized for disaggregated serving, their performance and energy implications have not been rigorously benchmarked. In this paper, we fill this research gap by re-evaluating prefill-decode disaggregation under different KV transfer mediums and optimization strategies. Specifically, we include a new colocated serving baseline and evaluate disaggregated setups under different KV cache transfer paths. Through GPU profiling using dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), we identify and compare the performance-energy Pareto frontiers across all setups to evaluate the potential energy savings enabled by disaggregation. Our results show that performance benefits from prefill-decode disaggregation are not guaranteed and depend on the request load and KV transfer mediums. In addition, stage-wise independent frequency scaling enabled by disaggregation does not lead to energy saving due to inherently higher energy consumption of disaggregated serving."}

Such behavior is modeled by the Time-Varying Holding Cost (TVHC) problem, where each job's instantaneous holding cost increases with its current age (a job's age is the time since it arrived). The goal of the TVHC problem is to find a scheduling policy that minimizes the time-average total holding cost across all jobs.\n  However, no optimality results are known for the TVHC problem outside of the asymptotic regime. In this paper, we study a simple yet still challenging special case: A two-class M/M/1 queue in which class 1 jobs incur a non-decreasing, time-varying holding cost and class 2 jobs incur a constant holding cost.\n  Our main contribution is deriving the first optimal (non-decreasing) index policy for this special case of the TVHC problem. Our optimal policy, called LookAhead, stems from the following idea: Rather than considering each job's current holding cost when making scheduling decisions, we should look at their cost some $X$ time into the future, where this $X$ is intuitively called the ``lookahead amount.\" This paper derives that optimal lookahead amount."}

One of the main challenges in parallel BFT is the view change process that happens when the leader node fails, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. Existing parallel BFT protocols typically rely on passive view change mechanisms with blind leader rotation. Such approaches frequently select unavailable or slow nodes as leaders, resulting in degraded performance. To address these challenges, we propose a View Change Optimization (VCO) model based on mixed integer programming that optimizes leader selection and follower reassignment across parallel committees by considering communication delays and failure scenarios. We applied a decomposition method with efficient subproblems and improved benders cuts to solve the VCO model. Leveraging the results of improved decomposition solution method, we propose an efficient iterative backup leader selection algorithm as views proceed. By performing experiments in Microsoft Azure cloud environments, we demonstrate that the VCO-driven parallel BFT outperforms existing configuration methods under both normal operation and faulty condition. The results show that the VCO model is effective as network size increases, making it a suitable solution for high-performance parallel BFT systems."}

Cloud providers are increasingly integrating high-performance computing capabilities in their infrastructures, such as hardware accelerators and high-speed interconnects, while researchers in the high-performance computing community are starting to explore cloud-native paradigms to improve scalability, elasticity, and resource utilization. In this context, serverless computing emerges as a promising execution model to efficiently handle highly dynamic, parallel, and distributed workloads. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review of 122 research articles published between 2018 and early 2025, exploring the use of the serverless paradigm to develop, deploy, and orchestrate compute-intensive applications across cloud, high-performance computing, and hybrid environments. From these, a taxonomy comprising eight primary research directions and nine targeted use case domains is proposed, alongside an analysis of recent publication trends and collaboration networks among authors, highlighting the growing interest and interconnections within this emerging research field. Overall, this work aims to offer a valuable foundation for both new researchers and experienced practitioners, guiding the development of next-generation serverless solutions for parallel compute-intensive applications."}
