Dodoor leverages advanced\nresearch on the weighted balls-into-bins model with b-batched setting. Unlike\nother decentralized schedulers that rely on real-time probing of remote\nservers, Dodoor makes scheduling decisions based on cached server information,\nwhich is updated in batches, to reduce communication overheads. To schedule\ntasks with dynamic, multidimensional resource requirements in heterogeneous\ncluster, Dodoor uses a novel load score to measure servers' loads for each\nscheduled task. This score captures the anti-affinity between servers and tasks\nin contrast to the commonly used heuristic of counting pending tasks to balance\nload. On a 101-node heterogeneous cluster, Dodoor is evaluated using two\nworkloads: (i) simulated Azure virtual machines placements and (ii) real\nserverless Python functions executions in Docker. The evaluation shows that\nDodoor reduces scheduling messages by 55--66% on both workloads.

However, current disaggregated\nsystems face three key limitations: (i) static resource allocation cannot adapt\nto highly dynamic workloads, causing over-provisioning that wastes resources or\nunder-provisioning that violates service level objectives (SLOs); (ii) inherent\nload imbalance between prefill and decode stages, where prefill is\ncompute-bound and decode is memory-bound, causes under-utilization in one tier\nwhile the other becomes a bottleneck; and (iii) prefix cache aware routing\nskews load distribution, as high cache hit rate prefill nodes attract\ndisproportionately more requests, further degrading balance and efficiency. To\naddress these issues, we present BanaServe, a dynamic orchestration framework\nthat continuously rebalances computational and memory resources across prefill\nand decode instances while eliminating hotspots induced by cache. BanaServe\nintroduces layer level weight migration, attention level Key Value Cache (KV\nCache) migration, and Global KV Cache Store sharing with layer wise overlapped\ntransmission, enabling both coarse grained (layer level) and fine grained\n(attention level) load redistribution with minimal latency overhead.

An\noptimal solution to the reduced instance can be easily used to construct an\noptimal solution for the original input.\n  In this work, we present the first distributed-memory parallel reduction\nalgorithms for this problem, targeting graphs beyond the scale of previous\nsequential approaches.
