Although prior works have focused on\nindividual stages, comprehensive comparisons of full ETL workflows across\nprogramming languages using Apache Iceberg remain limited. The analysis was\nperformed by executing several operations, including downloading data from CSV\nfiles, transforming and loading it into an Apache Iceberg analytical table. It\nwas found that the performance of the Spark algorithm varies significantly\ndepending on the amount of data and the programming language used. When\nprocessing a 5-megabyte CSV file, the best result was achieved in Python: 6.71\nseconds, which is superior to Scala's score of 9.13 seconds and Java's time of\n9.62 seconds. For processing a large CSV file of 1.6 gigabytes, all programming\nlanguages demonstrated similar results: the fastest performance was showed in\nPython: 46.34 seconds, while Scala and Java showed results of 47.72 and 50.56\nseconds, respectively. When performing a more complex operation that involved\ncombining two CSV files into a single dataset for further loading into an\nApache Iceberg table, Scala demonstrated the highest performance, at 374.42\nseconds.

In this work, we study the\nlocality of matching problems in the family of regular graphs, which is one of\nthe main benchmarks for establishing lower bounds on the locality of\nsymmetry-breaking problems, as well as for obtaining classification results.\nFor approximate matching, we develop randomized algorithms to show that $(1 +\n\\epsilon)$-approximate matching in regular graphs is truly local; i.e., the\nlocality depends only on $\\epsilon$ and is independent of all other graph\nparameters. Furthermore, as long as the degree $\\Delta$ is not very small\n(namely, as long as $\\Delta \\geq \\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$), this dependence is\nonly logarithmic in $1/\\epsilon$. This stands in sharp contrast to maximal\nmatching in regular graphs which requires some dependence on the number of\nnodes $n$ or the degree $\\Delta$. We show matching lower bounds for both\nresults. For maximal matching, our techniques further allow us to establish a\nstrong separation between the node-averaged complexity and worst-case\ncomplexity of maximal matching in regular graphs, by showing that the former is\nonly $O(1)$. Central to our main technical contribution is a novel\nmartingale-based analysis for the $\\approx 40$-year-old algorithm by Luby.

RL workflows involve\ninterleaving rollout and training stages with fundamentally different resource\nrequirements. Rollout typically dominates overall execution time, yet scales\nefficiently through multiple independent instances. In contrast, training\nrequires tightly-coupled GPUs with full-mesh communication. Existing RL\nframeworks fall into two categories: co-located and disaggregated\narchitectures. Co-located ones fail to address this resource tension by forcing\nboth stages to share the same GPUs. Disaggregated architectures, without\nmodifications of well-established RL algorithms, suffer from resource\nunder-utilization. Meanwhile, preemptible GPU resources, i.e., spot instances\non public clouds and spare capacity in production clusters, present significant\ncost-saving opportunities for accelerating RL workflows, if efficiently\nharvested for rollout.\n  In this paper, we present RLBoost, a systematic solution for cost-efficient\nRL training that harvests preemptible GPU resources. Our key insight is that\nrollout's stateless and embarrassingly parallel nature aligns perfectly with\npreemptible and often fragmented resources. To efficiently utilize these\nresources despite frequent and unpredictable availability changes, RLBoost\nadopts a hybrid architecture with three key techniques: (1) adaptive rollout\noffload to dynamically adjust workloads on the reserved (on-demand) cluster,\n(2) pull-based weight transfer that quickly provisions newly available\ninstances, and (3) token-level response collection and migration for efficient\npreemption handling and continuous load balancing.

However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single\nDC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under\nthis, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due\nto the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations\nattempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit\nin low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.\nTherefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical\nroadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.\n  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize\nEP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the\nspatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and\nfrequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is\nnon-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original\ncommunication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore\nbuild a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided\nby this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct\nthe mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU\nlevel, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by\nreducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining\nall these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better\nscalability.
