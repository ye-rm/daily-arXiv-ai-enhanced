Manually tuning these parameters for optimal performance demands considerable expertise, while traditional auto-tuning approaches struggle with the enormous search space and low sample efficiency inherent to this domain. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation and logical reasoning, offering new possibilities for system optimization. However, applying LLMs to real-time compaction tuning in such latency-sensitive environments is a double-edged sword. While large-scale LLMs can offer superior reasoning for strategy generation, their high inference latency and computational cost make them impractical for interactive, low-latency tuning. In contrast, small-scale LLMs achieve low latency but often at the expense of reasoning accuracy and tuning effectiveness. In this paper, we first evaluate this trade-off by analyzing the compaction-tuning performance and inference latency of LLMs at different scales in an LSM-tree-based tuning case. We then characterize the performance of LSM-tree on RocksDB v8.8.1, with a focus on adjusting the key compaction-related parameters under db_bench workloads. Our experimental results show a clear positive correlation between model capability and tuning effectiveness."}

Specifically, the quantization module, called Brevitas, is applied to implement fixed-point data processing, which allows for arbitrary specification of the bit widths for the integer and fractional parts. Two methods of fixed-point data quantization, quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ), are utilized in Brevitas. With Tensil, which is used in the current design flow, the bit widths of the integer and fractional parts need to be 8 bits each or 16 bits each when implemented in hardware, but performance validation has shown that accuracy comparable to floating-point operations can be maintained even with 6 bits or 5 bits each, indicating potential for further reduction in computational resources. These results clearly contribute to the creation of a versatile design and evaluation environment for edge AI hardware for few-shot learning."}

Meshed graphs form a general class of graphs defined by a distance condition. They comprise several important classes of graphs, which have long been the subject of intensive studies in metric graph theory, geometric group theory, and discrete mathematics: median graphs, bridged graphs, chordal graphs, Helly graphs, dual polar graphs, modular, weakly modular graphs, and basis graphs of matroids. We also provide 3-local proof labeling schemes to recognize these subclasses of meshed graphs using labels of size $O(\\log D)$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the graph).\n  To establish these results, we show that in meshed graphs, we can verify locally that every vertex $v$ is labeled by its distance $d(s,v)$ to an arbitrary root $s$. To design proof labeling schemes to recognize the subclasses of meshed graphs mentioned above, we use this distance verification to ensure that the triangle-square complex of the graph is simply connected and we then rely on existing local-to-global characterizations for the different classes we consider.\n  To get a proof-labeling scheme for leader election with labels of constant size, we then show that we can check locally if every $v$ is labeled by $d(s,v) \\pmod{3}$ for some root $s$ that we designate as the leader."}

Cache data analysis requires parsing millions of trace entries with manual filtering, making the process slow and non-interactive. To address this, we introduce CacheMind, a conversational tool that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable semantic reasoning over cache traces. Architects can now ask natural language questions like, \"Why is the memory access associated with PC X causing more evictions?\", and receive trace-grounded, human-readable answers linked to program semantics for the first time. To evaluate CacheMind, we present CacheMindBench, the first verified benchmark suite for LLM-based reasoning for the cache replacement problem. Using the SIEVE retriever, CacheMind achieves 66.67% on 75 unseen trace-grounded questions and 84.80% on 25 unseen policy-specific reasoning tasks; with RANGER, it achieves 89.33% and 64.80% on the same evaluations. Additionally, with RANGER, CacheMind achieves 100% accuracy on 4 out of 6 categories in the trace-grounded tier of CacheMindBench. Compared to LlamaIndex (10% retrieval success), SIEVE achieves 60% and RANGER achieves 90%, demonstrating that existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) are insufficient for precise, trace-grounded microarchitectural reasoning. We provided four concrete actionable insights derived using CacheMind, wherein bypassing use case improved cache hit rate by 7.66% and speedup by 2.04%, software fix use case gives speedup of 76%, and Mockingjay replacement policy use case gives speedup of 0.7%; showing the utility of CacheMind on non-trivial queries that require a natural-language interface."}

To address this, we present MXFormer, a novel, hybrid, weight-stationary Compute-in-Memory (CIM) accelerator that provides high throughput and efficiency for fixed-model inference on large short-sequence Transformers. Our architecture's foundation is the use of ultra-dense Charge-Trap Transistors (CTTs) in Microscaling MXFP4 CIM arrays, uniquely enabling the on-chip storage of up to hundreds of millions of parameters in Fully Weight Stationary (FWS) fashion.\n  We introduce a statically partitioned design with 12 Transformer blocks connected by a deeply pipelined dataflow. Static-weight layers (MLPs and linear projections) execute on highly parallel analog CTT arrays using an MXFP4-native flow with per-block exponent alignment and a 10-bit SAR ADC. Dynamic computations are handled in fully accurate digital blocks that utilize MXFP-enabled systolic arrays for scaled dot-product attention and vector units for LayerNorm and FlashAttention-style Softmax.\n  By eliminating all weight movement, the deeply pipelined MXFormer architecture yields very high single-stream throughput and efficiency, processing 58275 FPS on ViT-L/32 (dual-chip) or 41269 FPS on ViT-B/16 (single chip). MXFormer outperforms comparable state-of-the-art non-FWS digital, hybrid and photonic Transformer accelerators ~3.3x-60.5x in compute density and ~1.7x-2.5x in energy efficiency. Against FWS accelerators, MXFormer improves compute density by ~20.9x and resident weight storage density by ~2x, while preserving near-digital accuracy (drop of <1%) without any model retraining."}

These systems rely heavily on distributed architectures, requiring robust mechanisms to manage data and interactions among participants securely. One critical aspect of decentralized systems is key management, which is essential for encrypting files, securing database segments, and enabling private transactions. However, securely managing cryptographic keys in a distributed environment poses significant risks, especially when nodes in the network can be compromised [9]. This research proposes a decentralized database scheme specifically designed for secure and private key management. Our approach ensures that cryptographic keys are not stored explicitly at any location, preventing their discovery even if an attacker gains control of multiple nodes. Instead of traditional storage, keys are encoded and distributed using the BFLUT (Bloom Filter for Private Look-Up Tables) algorithm [7], which enables secure retrieval without direct exposure. The system leverages OrbitDB [4], IPFS [1], and IPNS [10] for decentralized data management, providing robust support for consistency, scalability, and simultaneous updates. By combining these technologies, our scheme enhances both security and privacy while maintaining high performance and reliability. Our findings demonstrate the system's capability to securely manage keys, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure privacy, making it a foundational solution for Web3 applications requiring decentralized security."}

As network bandwidths continue to scale, the CPU overhead associated with RPC processing, particularly serialization, deserialization, and protocol handling, has become a critical bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated by fast user-space networking stacks such as DPDK, which expose RPC processing as the dominant performance limiter. While prior work has explored software optimizations and FPGA-based offload engines, these approaches remain physically distant from the CPU's memory hierarchy, incurring unnecessary data movement and cache pollution. We present Arcalis, a near-cache RPC accelerator that positions a lightweight hardware engine adjacent to the last-level cache (LLC). Arcalis offloads RPC processing to dedicated microengines on receive and transmit paths that operate with cache-line latency while preserving programmability. By decoupling RPC processing logic, enabling microservice-specific execution, and positioning itself near the LLC to immediately consume data injected by network cards, Arcalis achieves 1.79-4.16$\\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the CPU baseline, while significantly reducing microarchitectural overhead by up to 88%, and achieves up to a 1.62$\\times$ higher throughput than prior solutions. These results highlight the potential of near-cache RPC acceleration as a practical solution for high-performance microservice deployment."}

A Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU) is a parameterizable FPGA-based accelerator module optimized for ML inference. It supports a wide range of ML models and can be instantiated multiple times within a single FPGA to enable concurrent execution. This paper introduces DPUConfig, a novel runtime management framework, based on a custom Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, that dynamically selects optimal DPU configurations by leveraging real-time telemetry data monitoring, system utilization, power consumption, and application performance to inform its configuration selection decisions. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that the RL agent achieves energy efficiency 95% (on average) of the optimal attainable energy efficiency for several CNN models on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU102."}

Meanwhile, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have become dominant, with rapidly increasing model sizes but low degree of parameter reuse compared to conventional CNNs, making end-to-end execution on resource-limited devices extremely challenging. To address these challenges, we propose TriGen, a novel NPU architecture tailored for resource-constrained environments through software-hardware co-design. Firstly, TriGen adopts low-precision computation using microscaling (MX) to enable additional optimization opportunities while preserving accuracy, and resolves the issues that arise by employing such precision. Secondly, to jointly optimize both nonlinear and linear operations, TriGen eliminates the need for specialized hardware for essential nonlinear operations by using fast and accurate LUT, thereby maximizing performance gains and reducing hardware-cost in on-device environments, and finally, by taking practical hardware constraints into account, further employs scheduling techniques to maximize computational utilization even under limited on-chip memory capacity. We evaluate the performance of TriGen on various LLMs and show that TriGen achieves an average 2.73x performance speedup and 52% less memory transfer over the baseline NPU design with negligible accuracy loss."}
