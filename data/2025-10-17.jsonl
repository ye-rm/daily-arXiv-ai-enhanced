By repeatedly opening or keeping a\nDRAM row (aggressor row) open, we show that it is possible to disturb DRAM\ncells through a DRAM column (i.e., bitline) and induce bitflips in DRAM cells\nsharing the same columns as the aggressor row (across multiple DRAM subarrays).\nWith ColumnDisturb, the activation of a single row concurrently disturbs cells\nacross as many as three subarrays (e.g., 3072 rows) as opposed to\nRowHammer/RowPress, which affect only a few neighboring rows of the aggressor\nrow in a single subarray. We rigorously characterize ColumnDisturb and its\ncharacteristics under various operational conditions using 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2\nchips from three major manufacturers. Among our 27 key experimental\nobservations, we highlight two major results and their implications.\n  First, ColumnDisturb affects chips from all three major manufacturers and\nworsens as DRAM technology scales down to smaller node sizes (e.g., the minimum\ntime to induce the first ColumnDisturb bitflip reduces by up to 5.06x). We\nobserve that, in existing DRAM chips, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips within a\nstandard DDR4 refresh window (e.g., in 63.6 ms) in multiple cells. We predict\nthat, as DRAM technology node size reduces, ColumnDisturb would worsen in\nfuture DRAM chips, likely causing many more bitflips in the standard refresh\nwindow. Second, ColumnDisturb induces bitflips in many (up to 198x) more rows\nthan retention failures. Therefore, ColumnDisturb has strong implications for\nretention-aware refresh mechanisms that leverage the heterogeneity in cell\nretention times: our detailed analyses show that ColumnDisturb greatly reduces\nthe benefits of such mechanisms."}

However, VCs introduce significant overhead in the switch in\nterms of area, power, and design complexity, limiting the switch scalability.\nThis paper starts by revisiting VC-less routing through link ordering schemes\nin Full-mesh networks, which offer implementation simplicity but suffer from\nperformance degradation under adversarial traffic. Thus, to overcome these\nchallenges, we propose TERA (Topology-Embedded Routing Algorithm), a novel\nrouting algorithm which employs an embedded physical subnetwork to provide\ndeadlock-free non-minimal paths without using VCs.\n  In a Full-mesh network, TERA outperforms link ordering routing algorithms by\n80% when dealing with adversarial traffic, and up to 100% in application\nkernels. Furthermore, compared to other VC-based approaches, it reduces buffer\nrequirements by 50%, while maintaining comparable latency and throughput.\nLastly, early results from a 2D-HyperX evaluation show that TERA outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms that use the same number of VCs, achieving\nperformance improvements of up to 32%."}

Let $n$ be the number of bins and $m(t)$ the total\nload at time $t$. We are interested in bounding the discrepancy $x_{\\max}(t) -\nm(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to current average) and the overload\n$x_{\\max}(t) - m_{\\max}(t)/n$ (current maximum load relative to highest average\nobserved so far).\n  We prove that at an arbitrarily chosen time $t$ the total number of balls\nabove the average is $O(n)$ and that the discrepancy is $ O(\\log(n))$. For the\ndiscrepancy, we provide a matching lower bound. Furthermore we prove that at an\narbitrarily chosen time $t$ the overload is $\\log\\log(n)+O(1)$. For \"good\"\ninsertion probability sequences (in which the average load of time intervals\nwith polynomial length increases in expectation) we show that even the\ndiscrepancy is bounded by $\\log\\log(n)+O(1)$.\n  One of our main analytical tools is a layered induction, as per [ABKU99].\nSince our model allows for rather more general scenarios than what was\npreviously considered, the formal analysis requires some extra ingredients as\nwell, in particular a detailed potential analysis. Furthermore, we simplify the\nsetup by applying probabilistic couplings to obtain certain \"recovery\"\nproperties, which eliminate much of the need for intricate and careful\nconditioning elsewhere in the analysis."}
