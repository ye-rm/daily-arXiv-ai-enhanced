However, supporting nested virtualization significantly increases host hypervisor complexity and introduces a new attack surface in cloud platforms. While many prior studies have explored hypervisor fuzzing, none has explicitly addressed nested virtualization due to the challenge of generating effective virtual machine (VM) instances with a vast state space as fuzzing inputs.\n  We present NecoFuzz, the first fuzzing framework that systematically targets nested virtualization-specific logic in hypervisors. NecoFuzz synthesizes executable fuzz-harness VMs with internal states near the boundary between valid and invalid, guided by an approximate model of hardware-assisted virtualization specifications. Since vulnerabilities in nested virtualization often stem from incorrect handling of unexpected VM states, this specification-guided, boundary-oriented generation significantly improves coverage of security-critical code across different hypervisors.\n  We implemented NecoFuzz on Intel VT-x and AMD-V by extending AFL++ to support fuzz-harness VMs. NecoFuzz achieved 84.7% and 74.2% code coverage for nested virtualization-specific code on Intel VT-x and AMD-V, respectively, and uncovered six previously unknown vulnerabilities across three hypervisors, including two assigned CVEs."}

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that encodes input features into low-precision, high-dimensional vectors with simple element-wise operations, making it well-suited for resource-constrained edge platforms. Recent work enhances HDC accuracy for graph classification via Nyström kernel approximations. Edge acceleration of such methods faces several challenges: (i) redundancy among (landmark) samples selected via uniform sampling, (ii) storing the Nyström projection matrix under limited on-chip memory, (iii) expensive, contention-prone codebook lookups, and (iv) load imbalance due to irregular sparsity in SpMV. To address these challenges, we propose NysX, the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for Nyström-based HDC graph classification at the edge. NysX integrates four key optimizations: (i) a hybrid landmark selection strategy combining uniform sampling with determinantal point processes (DPPs) to reduce redundancy while improving accuracy; (ii) a streaming architecture for Nyström projection matrix maximizing external memory bandwidth utilization; (iii) a minimal-perfect-hash lookup engine enabling $O(1)$ key-to-index mapping with low on-chip memory overhead; and (iv) sparsity-aware SpMV engines with static load balancing. Together, these innovations enable real-time, energy-efficient inference on resource-constrained platforms. Implemented on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ (ZCU104) FPGA, NysX achieves $6.85\\times$ ($4.32\\times$) speedup and $169\\times$ ($314\\times$) energy efficiency gains over optimized CPU (GPU) baselines, while improving classification accuracy by $3.4\\%$ on average across TUDataset benchmarks, a widely used standard for graph classification."}

While most are deployed in single node setups, CXL.mem is a technology that implements memories that can be attached to multiple nodes simultaneously, enabling shared memory pooling. This opens new possibilities, particularly for efficient inter-node communication.\n  In this paper, we present a novel performance evaluation toolchain combined with an extended performance model for message-based communication, which can be used to predict potential performance benefits from using CXL.mem for data exchange. Our approach analyzes data access patterns of MPI applications: it analyzes on-node accesses to/from MPI buffers, as well as cross-node MPI traffic to gather a full understanding of the impact of memory performance. We combine this data in an extended performance model to predict which data transfers could benefit from direct CXL.mem implementations as compared to traditional MPI messages. Our model works on a per-MPI call granularity, allowing the identification and later optimizations of those MPI invocations in the code with the highest potential for speedup by using CXL.mem.\n  For our toolchain, we extend the memory trace sampling tool Mitos and use it to extract data access behavior. In the post-processing step, the raw data is automatically analyzed to provide performance models for each individual MPI call. We validate the models on two sample applications -- a 2D heat transfer miniapp and the HPCG benchmark -- and use them to demonstrate their support for targeted optimizations by integrating CXL.mem."}

After performing an evaluation in several domains, it is highly informative to compute a (weighted) mean performance and, as shown in this paper, to scrutinize what happens during this averaging. To achieve this goal, we adopt a probabilistic framework and consider a performance as a probability measure (e.g., a normalized confusion matrix for a classification task). It appears that the corresponding weighted mean is known to be the summarization, and that only some remarkable scores assign to the summarized performance a value equal to a weighted arithmetic mean of the values assigned to the domain-specific performances. These scores include the family of ranking scores, a continuum parameterized by user preferences, and that the weights to consider in the arithmetic mean depend on the user preferences. Based on this, we rigorously define four domains, named easiest, most difficult, preponderant, and bottleneck domains, as functions of user preferences. After establishing the theory in a general setting, regardless of the task, we develop new visual tools for two-class classification."}

We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks.

This innovative system is established based on the Global Data Plane in the area of edge computing. Our comprehensive design and implementation of CFS successfully fulfill the objective of providing a multi-credential Common Access API. The architecture of CFS is methodically segmented into three integral components: Firstly, the DataCapsule server, tasked with the storage, dissemination, and replication of DataCapsules on the edge. Secondly, the middleware, a crucial element running in a Trusted Execution Environment responsible for the enforcement and management of write permissions and requests. Finally, the client component, which manifests as a POSIX-compliant filesystem, is adaptable and operational across many architectures. Experimental evaluations of CFS reveal that, while its read and write performances are comparatively modest, it upholds a high degree of functional correctness. This attribute distinctly positions CFS as a viable candidate for application in real-world software development scenarios. The paper also delineates potential future enhancements, aimed at augmenting the practicality of CFS in the landscape of software development."}

Motivated by this architectural trend, the emulation of high-precision matrix multiplication using low-precision hardware has attracted significant interest in the high-performance computing community. Ozaki, Uchino, and Imamura introduced the Ozaki-II scheme as a general framework for emulating matrix multiplication. Building on this framework, Uchino, Ozaki, and Imamura developed high-performance and power-efficient techniques for emulating single- and double-precision real matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines. Extending this line of research, the present study proposes high-performance emulation methods for single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication on INT8 matrix engines, based on the Ozaki-II scheme. On an NVIDIA B200 GPU, the proposed methods achieve 4.0x--5.6x and 4.4x--6.5x speedups over the native single- and double-precision complex matrix multiplication routines from cuBLAS, respectively, for sufficiently large problem sizes. When lower accuracy than that of the standard routine is acceptable, the proposed methods can operate at even higher speed. Conversely, with only a modest increase in computation time, they can also deliver higher accuracy than the standard routines. These properties suggest that the proposed approach has the potential to serve as a default algorithm across a wide range of applications."}

While existing optimization efforts focus primarily on hardware energy efficiency, a significant but overlooked source of inefficiency is software energy waste caused by poor software design. This often includes redundant or poorly designed operations that consume more energy without improving performance. These inefficiencies arise in widely used ML frameworks and applications, yet developers often lack the visibility and tools to detect and diagnose them.\n  We propose differential energy debugging, a novel approach that leverages the observation that competing ML systems often implement similar functionality with vastly different energy consumption. Building on this insight, we design and implement Magneton, an energy profiler that compares energy consumption between similar ML systems at the operator level and automatically pinpoints code regions and configuration choices responsible for excessive energy use. Applied to 9 popular ML systems spanning LLM inference, general ML frameworks, and image generation, Magneton detects and diagnoses 16 known cases of software energy inefficiency and further discovers 8 previously unknown cases, 7 of which have been confirmed by developers."}

However, implementations for access by programmable alternatives known as lightweight threads (also referred to as asynchronous calls or coroutines) have not been thoroughly studied. The main advantage of lightweight threads is their significantly lower overhead during launch and context switching. However, this comes at a cost: to achieve proper parallelism, context switches must be manually invoked in the code; without these switches, new lightweight threads will never be executed.\n  In this paper, we focus on the simplest multithreaded data structure: a mutex (also known as a lock). We demonstrate that original implementations for OS threads cannot be used effectively in this new context due to the potential for deadlocks. Furthermore, correctness is not the only concern. In certain languages, such as C++, there are various lightweight thread libraries, each with different implementations and interfaces, which necessitate distinct lock implementations.\n  In this work, we present a modification of TTAS and MCS locks for the use from lightweight threads and demonstrate that the two context switch mechanisms of lightweight threads, yielding and sleeping, are crucial. However, the performance of TTAS and MCS may differ significantly depending on the settings. If one wants to have a lock that works well for any library, we suggest using the cohort lock, which strikes a balance between MCS and TTAS by utilizing several MCS queues with a common TTAS."}

Specifically, if the model of the system can be interpreted as a finite-state automaton, we can generate an exhaustive test suite for the implementation that covers all possible states and transitions.\n  In this paper, we discuss how to efficiently generate such a test suite for distributed systems written in the actor model. Importantly, our approach does not require any modifications to the code or interfering with the distributed system execution environment. As an example, we verified an implementation of a replication algorithm based on Viewstamped Replication, which is used in a real-world system."}

Specifically, we perform a simulation study using real-world data from multiple cloud providers (AWS and Azure) and workload traces for different applications (big data analytics and FaaS). Our simulation results indicate that spatial shifting can substantially lower carbon, water, and land use footprints, with observed reductions ranging from 20% to 85%, depending on the scenario and optimization criteria. Temporal shifting also decreases the footprint, though to a lesser extent. When applied together, the two strategies yield the greatest overall reduction, driven mainly by spatial shifting with temporal adjustments providing an additional, incremental benefit. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that such shifting is robust to prediction errors in grid mix data and to variations across different seasons."}
