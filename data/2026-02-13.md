### [1] [Calibration and Evaluation of Car-Following Models for Autonomous Shuttles Using a Novel Multi-Criteria Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11517)
*Renan Favero,Lily Elefteriadou*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: This paper develops and evaluates car-following models for autonomous shuttles using real-world trajectory data, comparing machine learning algorithms with traditional physics-based models through a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for dedicated car-following models for autonomous shuttles (AS) due to their distinct operating characteristics from conventional autonomous vehicles. Current research lacks calibrated models using field data, hasn't explored advanced machine learning techniques for AS trajectories, and lacks a unified framework for systematic evaluation and comparison of car-following model performance.

Method: The study calibrates a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models. It introduces a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity for systematic assessment.

Result: The calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance. Sequential models like LSTM and CNN captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. Traditional models (IDM, ACC) and kernel methods showed lower accuracy and stability compared to most machine learning models tested.

Conclusion: Machine learning approaches, particularly XGBoost, show superior performance for modeling autonomous shuttle car-following behavior compared to traditional physics-based models. The proposed multi-criteria evaluation framework provides a generalizable methodology for systematic assessment of car-following models, addressing limitations in existing evaluation practices.

Abstract: Autonomous shuttles (AS) are fully autonomous transit vehicles with operating characteristics distinct from conventional autonomous vehicles (AV). Developing dedicated car-following models for AS is critical to understanding their traffic impacts; however, few studies have calibrated such models with field data. More advanced machine learning (ML) techniques have not yet been applied to AS trajectories, leaving the potential of ML for capturing AS dynamics unexplored and constraining the development of dedicated AS models. Furthermore, there is a lack of a unified framework for systematically evaluating and comparing the performance of car-following models to replicate real trajectories. Existing car-following studies often rely on disparate metrics, which limit reproducibility and performance comparability.
  This study addresses these gaps through two main contributions: (1) the calibration of a diverse set of car-following models using real-world AS trajectory data, including eight machine learning algorithms and two physics-based models; and (2) the introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation framework that integrates measures of prediction accuracy, trajectory stability, and statistical similarity, which provides a generalizable methodology for a systematic assessment of car-following models.
  Results indicated that the proposed calibrated XGBoost model achieved the best overall performance. Sequential model type, such as LSTM and CNN, captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. LSTM and CNN captured long-term positional stability but were less responsive to short-term dynamics. Traditional models (IDM, ACC) and kernel methods showed lower accuracy and stability than most ML models tested.

Abstract: This paper presents an ML-driven framework for automated RF physical synthesis that transforms circuit netlists into manufacturable GDSII layouts. While recent ML approaches demonstrate success in topology selection and parameter optimization, they fail to produce manufacturable layouts due to oversimplified component models and lack of routing capabilities.

The neural inductor model demonstrates superior accuracy across 1-100 GHz, enabling EM-accurate component synthesis with real-time inference. The framework successfully generates DRC-aware GDSII layouts for RF circuits, representing a significant step toward automated RF physical design.

*Yousuf Choudhary,Tosiron Adegbija*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: This paper presents a device-circuit co-designed read/write interface for Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions (AFMTJs) that addresses their ultrafast dynamics and low tunnel magnetoresistance challenges, enabling reliable in-memory computing applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFMTJs offer picosecond switching and high integration density advantages for in-memory computing, but their ultrafast dynamics and low TMR make existing MRAM interfaces unreliable, requiring specialized interface circuits.

Method: The researchers developed a device-circuit co-designed interface using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model as baseline. They proposed an asymmetric pulse driver for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier with dynamic trip-point tuning for low-TMR sensing.

Result: SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations show the proposed circuits preserve AFMTJ latency and energy benefits while achieving robust read/write yield under realistic PVT variations and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming standard MRAM front-ends.

Conclusion: The co-designed interface successfully addresses AFMTJ reliability challenges, enabling practical implementation of AFMTJ-based in-memory computing systems with preserved performance advantages.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions (AFMTJs) offer picosecond switching and high integration density for in-memory computing, but their ultrafast dynamics and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) make state-of-the-art MRAM interfaces unreliable. This work develops a device-circuit co-designed read/write interface optimized for AFMTJ behavior. Using a calibrated SPICE AFMTJ model as a baseline, we identify the limitations of conventional drivers and propose an asymmetric pulse driver (PD) for deterministic picosecond switching and a self-timed sense amplifier (STSA) with dynamic trip-point tuning for low-TMR sensing. Our experiments using SPICE and Monte Carlo evaluations demonstrate that the proposed circuits preserve AFMTJ latency and energy benefits while achieving robust read/write yield under realistic PVT and 3D integration parasitics, outperforming standard MRAM front-ends under the same conditions.

### [5] [PAM: Processing Across Memory Hierarchy for Efficient KV-centric LLM Serving System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11521)
*Lian Liu,Shixin Zhao,Yutian Zhou,Yintao He,Mengdi Wang,Yinhe Han,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: PAM is a KV-centric LLM serving system that uses heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory in a hierarchical architecture to address memory bandwidth and capacity bottlenecks in LLM serving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems fail to handle memory-intensive KV operations effectively, and current single-level memory designs cannot satisfy both bandwidth and capacity requirements, creating critical bottlenecks as LLM adoption grows.

Method: PAM coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices in a hierarchical architecture, exploits KV access locality to distribute tokens, introduces PAMattention algorithm for parallel attention across devices, and implements KV mapping, migration, and scheduling mechanisms.

Result: PAM significantly enhances efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems by simultaneously addressing bandwidth and capacity demands.

Conclusion: PAM provides a cost-effective, high-performance solution for large-scale AI by balancing memory bandwidth with scalable capacity through hierarchical PIM coordination.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exponentially increased the demand for efficient serving systems. With growing requests and context lengths, key-value (KV)-related operations, including attention computation and KV cache storage, have emerged as critical bottlenecks. They require massive memory bandwidth and capacity. Unfortunately, existing LLM serving systems, optimized for compute-bound workloads, fail to handle these memory-intensive operations effectively. Even with Processing-In-Memory (PIM) technology, current single-level memory designs cannot simultaneously satisfy the bandwidth and capacity requirements.
  To address these challenges, we propose Processing Across Memory (PAM), a KV-centric LLM serving system that coordinates heterogeneous PIM-enabled memory devices within a hierarchical architecture. PAM introduces a novel computing paradigm to balance high memory bandwidth with scalable capacity. First, PAM exploits the inherent context locality in KV access patterns to intelligently distribute KV tokens across the memory hierarchy. Second, to further exploit context locality, it introduces the PAMattention algorithm, enabling fine-grained parallel attention computation across heterogeneous PIM devices. Finally, PAM incorporates an intra-device KV mapping, inter-device KV migration interface, and an inter-device online KV scheduling algorithm to dynamically balance computational workloads. By addressing both bandwidth and capacity demands simultaneously, PAM significantly enhances the efficiency and scalability of LLM serving systems, paving the way for cost-effective, high-performance solutions in the era of large-scale AI.

### [6] [Benchmarking for Single Feature Attribution with Microarchitecture Cliffs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11580)
*Hao Zhen,Qingxuan Kang,Yungang Bao,Trevor E. Carlson*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Microarchitecture Cliffs is a benchmark generation methodology that exposes mismatches between architectural simulators and RTL implementations to enable precise model calibration, reducing performance errors significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural simulators are essential for early microarchitectural exploration but often lack fidelity compared to RTL implementations, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Model calibration is needed to align simulator behavior with RTL ground truth.

Method: Proposes Microarchitecture Cliffs methodology that generates benchmarks to expose mismatches between simulator and RTL. Identifies key architectural components needing calibration and enables precise attribution of differences to single microarchitectural features. Includes automated tools to improve workflow efficiency.

Result: Applied to calibrate XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). Reduced performance error from 59.2% to 1.4% on Cliff benchmarks. Reduced relative error of representative microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. Lowered absolute performance error by 15.1% on SPECint2017 and 21.0% on SPECfp2017.

Conclusion: Microarchitecture Cliffs methodology effectively enables precise model calibration between architectural simulators and RTL implementations, significantly improving simulation accuracy and reducing performance estimation errors across various benchmark suites.

Abstract: Architectural simulators play a critical role in early microarchitectural exploration due to their flexibility and high productivity. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by fidelity: simulators may deviate from the behavior of the final RTL, leading to unreliable performance estimates. Consequently, model calibration, which aligns simulator behavior with the RTL as the ground-truth microarchitecture, becomes essential for achieving accurate performance modeling.
  To facilitate model calibration accuracy, we propose Microarchitecture Cliffs, a benchmark generation methodology designed to expose mismatches in microarchitectural behavior between the simulator and RTL. After identifying the key architectural components that require calibration, the Cliff methodology enables precise attribution of microarchitectural differences to a single microarchitectural feature through a set of benchmarks. In addition, we develop a set of automated tools to improve the efficiency of the Cliff workflow.
  We apply the Cliff methodology to calibrate the XiangShan version of gem5 (XS-GEM5) against the XiangShan open-source CPU (XS-RTL). We reduce the performance error of XS-GEM5 from 59.2% to just 1.4% on the Cliff benchmarks. Meanwhile, the calibration guided by Cliffs effectively reduces the relative error of a representative tightly coupled microarchitectural feature by 48.03%. It also substantially lowers the absolute performance error, with reductions of 15.1% and 21.0% on SPECint2017 and SPECfp2017, respectively.

### [7] [MING: An Automated CNN-to-Edge MLIR HLS framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11966)
*Jiahong Bi,Lars Schütze,Jeronimo Castrillon*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MING is an MLIR-based framework for FPGA HLS that addresses edge device resource constraints through streaming architecture with managed buffers, achieving significant speedups over existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge computing requires low-latency ML processing, but existing MLIR-based HLS frameworks overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices with FPGAs.

Method: Proposes MING, an MLIR-based framework that abstracts and automates HLS design process using streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers to handle resource constraints.

Result: Achieves 15x average speedup for standard CNN kernels (up to 4 layers), up to 200x for single-layer kernels, and generates efficient designs for larger inputs where other frameworks fail.

Conclusion: MING effectively addresses edge device resource constraints in FPGA HLS, outperforming state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining low-latency processing.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for low-latency and real-time processing, machine learning applications are steadily migrating toward edge computing platforms, where Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely adopted for their energy efficiency compared to CPUs and GPUs. To generate high-performance and low-power FPGA designs, several frameworks built upon High Level Synthesis (HLS) vendor tools have been proposed, among which MLIR-based frameworks are gaining significant traction due to their extensibility and ease of use. However, existing state-of-the-art frameworks often overlook the stringent resource constraints of edge devices. To address this limitation, we propose MING, an Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)-based framework that abstracts and automates the HLS design process. Within this framework, we adopt a streaming architecture with carefully managed buffers, specifically designed to handle resource constraints while ensuring low-latency. In comparison with recent frameworks, our approach achieves on average 15x speedup for standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernels with up to four layers, and up to 200x for single-layer kernels. For kernels with larger input sizes, MING is capable of generating efficient designs that respect hardware resource constraints, whereas state-of-the-art frameworks struggle to meet.

### [8] [Real Life Is Uncertain. Consensus Should Be Too!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11362)
*Reginald Frank,Soujanya Ponnapalli,Octavio Lomeli,Neil Giridharan,Marcos K Aguilera,Natacha Crooks*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper argues that traditional consensus protocols' f-threshold failure model oversimplifies real-world faults and proposes probabilistic consensus using individual machine failure curves for better reliability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional consensus protocols use an oversimplified f-threshold failure model that doesn't capture the complex, nuanced nature of real-world faults, limiting opportunities for optimization in cost and performance.

Method: Proposes probabilistic consensus protocols that leverage individual machine failure curves and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks like majority quorum intersection.

Result: Probabilistic consensus enables systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable by better modeling real-world fault characteristics.

Conclusion: A probabilistic failure model better captures practical fault patterns than the traditional f-threshold model, allowing for more optimized consensus protocols that improve system reliability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems rely on consensus protocols to build a fault-tolerant-core upon which they can build applications. Consensus protocols are correct under a specific failure model, where up to $f$ machines can fail. We argue that this $f$-threshold failure model oversimplifies the real world and limits potential opportunities to optimize for cost or performance. We argue instead for a probabilistic failure model that captures the complex and nuanced nature of faults observed in practice. Probabilistic consensus protocols can explicitly leverage individual machine \textit{failure curves} and explore side-stepping traditional bottlenecks such as majority quorum intersection, enabling systems that are more reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable.

### [9] [RL over Commodity Networks: Overcoming the Bandwidth Barrier with Lossless Sparse Deltas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11456)
*Chaoyi Ruan,Geng Luo,Xinyi Wan,Long Zhao,Qinghe Wang,Jiaan Zhu,Duling Xu,Guanbin Xu,Dehui Wei,Xiang Liu,Cheng Li,Haifeng Sun,Congcong Miao,Jialin Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SparrowRL is a high-performance RL training system that uses sparse delta updates to enable efficient LLM post-training across geographically distributed GPUs over commodity networks, achieving near-RDMA performance at lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL post-training for LLMs requires expensive RDMA HPC clusters due to frequent full-weight synchronization needs. Most organizations cannot afford this infrastructure, while using commodity Ethernet/WAN links causes excessive synchronization delays (100+ seconds for 8B models).

Method: SparrowRL exploits the observation that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse updates (~1% parameter changes). It represents each step as sparse delta checkpoints, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and uses throughput/bandwidth-aware scheduling with lease-based fault tolerance.

Result: On Qwen3 models (4B-14B) across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79× for Qwen3-8B, improves throughput by 2.4-9.5× over full-weight broadcast across WAN, and narrows throughput gap to within 8.91% of ideal RDMA baseline. It delivers 1.21-1.59× higher tokens per dollar than reserved RDMA clusters.

Conclusion: SparrowRL makes RL post-training practical on commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources by leveraging sparse update patterns, enabling cost-effective cross-cloud training with performance approaching expensive RDMA clusters.

Abstract: LLM post-training with reinforcement learning (RL) requires frequent synchronization of large model parameters between the trainer and distributed rollout actors. High-throughput RL post-training therefore relies on dedicated RDMA HPC clusters, an infrastructure cost most organizations cannot absorb. A natural alternative is to aggregate loosely-coupled GPUs over standard Ethernet and WAN links, but this commodity connectivity cannot sustain full-weight broadcasts: synchronizing an 8B model can take over 100~seconds on bandwidth-limited links, while rollout generation typically takes tens of seconds.
  Toward making RL practical in this regime, we observe that RL fine-tuning yields highly sparse per-step updates, with only around 1\% of parameter elements changing. Atop this insight, we present SparrowRL, a novel high-performance RL training system that preserves bit-exact updates without dropping or quantizing information, designed for commodity-networked, loosely-coupled GPU resources. SparrowRL represents each step as a sparse delta checkpoint, pipelines delta extraction with multi-stream transmission, overlaps transfer with rollout generation, and coordinates heterogeneous workers with throughput- and bandwidth-aware scheduling plus lease-based fault tolerance. On Qwen3 models from 4B to 14B deployed across up to four geographic regions, SparrowRL reduces per-step transfer payload by 79$\times$ for Qwen3-8B and improves throughput by 2.4--9.5$\times$ over full-weight broadcast across WAN, narrowing the throughput gap relative to an ideal RDMA single-datacenter baseline to within 8.91\%. By leveraging on-demand, cross-cloud GPUs over commodity links, SparrowRL delivers 1.21--1.59$\times$ higher tokens per dollar than reserved RDMA clusters at comparable throughput.

### [10] [Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum Protocol and Its Application in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11544)
*Yiming Zhou,Kaiping Xue,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: DPPS is a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized networks that provides plug-and-play privacy protection with novel sensitivity estimation, and PartPSP is its application for non-convex optimization using partial communication to improve privacy-utility trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy methods in decentralized networks are task-specific and lack general protocol-level solutions, leaving nodes vulnerable to inference attacks from curious neighbors.

Method: DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism requiring only one scalar broadcast per round, while PartPSP partitions model parameters into local/shared components and applies DPPS only to shared parameters to reduce noise injection.

Result: Theoretical convergence proofs for PartPSP under non-convex objectives, with experimental validation showing DPPS effectively preserves privacy and PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: DPPS provides a general, lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized networks, and PartPSP demonstrates its practical application with improved privacy-utility trade-off through partial communication mechanisms.

Abstract: In decentralized networks, nodes cannot ensure that their shared information will be securely preserved by their neighbors, making privacy vulnerable to inference by curious nodes. Adding calibrated random noise before communication to satisfy differential privacy offers a proven defense; however, most existing methods are tailored to specific downstream tasks and lack a general, protocol-level privacy-preserving solution. To bridge this gap, we propose Differentially Private Perturbed Push-Sum (DPPS), a lightweight differential privacy protocol for decentralized communication. Since protocol-level differential privacy introduces the unique challenge of obtaining the sensitivity for each communication round, DPPS introduces a novel sensitivity estimation mechanism that requires each node to compute and broadcast only one scalar per round, enabling rigorous differential privacy guarantees. This design allows DPPS to serve as a plug-and-play, low-cost privacy-preserving solution for downstream applications built on it. To provide a concrete instantiation of DPPS and better balance the privacy-utility trade-off, we design PartPSP, a privacy-preserving decentralized algorithm for non-convex optimization that integrates a partial communication mechanism. By partitioning model parameters into local and shared components and applying DPPS only to the shared parameters, PartPSP reduces the dimensionality of consensus data, thereby lowering the magnitude of injected noise and improving optimization performance. We theoretically prove that PartPSP converges under non-convex objectives and, with partial communication, achieves better optimization performance under the same privacy budget. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of DPPS's privacy-preserving and demonstrate that PartPSP outperforms existing privacy-preserving decentralized optimization algorithms.

*Xinyi Liu,Yujie Wang,Fangcheng Fu,Xuefeng Xiao,Huixia Li,Jiashi Li,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: LAER-MoE introduces Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP) to address load imbalance in MoE training by partitioning experts across devices and using dynamic re-layout strategies, achieving up to 1.69x speedup over state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic routing in expert parallel training causes significant load imbalance among experts, where overloaded experts become training bottlenecks that hinder overall iteration speed.

Method: Proposes Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP) that partitions each expert parameter across devices and restores partial experts via All-to-All communication, with fine-grained communication scheduling and a load balancing planner for expert re-layout and token routing strategies.

Result: Experiments on A100 cluster show LAER-MoE achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to current state-of-the-art training systems.

Conclusion: LAER-MoE effectively addresses load imbalance in MoE training through innovative parallelization and scheduling techniques, significantly improving training efficiency.

Abstract: Expert parallelism is vital for effectively training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, enabling different devices to host distinct experts, with each device processing different input data. However, during expert parallel training, dynamic routing results in significant load imbalance among experts: a handful of overloaded experts hinder overall iteration, emerging as a training bottleneck.
  In this paper, we introduce LAER-MoE, an efficient MoE training framework. The core of LAER-MoE is a novel parallel paradigm, Fully Sharded Expert Parallel (FSEP), which fully partitions each expert parameter by the number of devices and restores partial experts at expert granularity through All-to-All communication during training. This allows for flexible re-layout of expert parameters during training to enhance load balancing. In particular, we perform fine-grained scheduling of communication operations to minimize communication overhead. Additionally, we develop a load balancing planner to formulate re-layout strategies of experts and routing schemes for tokens during training. We perform experiments on an A100 cluster, and the results indicate that our system achieves up to 1.69x acceleration compared to the current state-of-the-art training systems.

TL;DR: A distributed rate limiting system using Redis Sorted Sets with Rolling Window algorithm, featuring atomic Lua scripting, three-layer architecture, and Redis Cluster deployment with AP trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental challenge of designing a rate limiter that balances accuracy, availability, and scalability in distributed systems, overcoming trade-offs between precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance.

Method: Uses Redis with Sorted Set data structure for O(log(N)) operations, implements Rolling Window algorithm with server-side Lua scripting for atomic operations, proposes three-layer architecture for rule management, and deploys on Redis Cluster with data sharding and replication.

Result: Quantifies accuracy and memory cost trade-off of Rolling Window vs Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms, demonstrates elimination of race conditions through atomic Lua operations, and enables rule changes without modifying cached scripts through parameter hashing.

Conclusion: The design provides a production-grade distributed rate limiting solution that accepts AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from CAP theorem as a pragmatic engineering trade-off, achieving efficient, low-latency operations while maintaining precision in concurrent environments.

Abstract: Designing a rate limiter that is simultaneously accurate, available, and scalable presents a fundamental challenge in distributed systems, primarily due to the trade-offs between algorithmic precision, availability, consistency, and partition tolerance. This article presents a concrete architecture for a distributed rate limiting system in a production-grade environment. Our design chooses the in-memory cache database, the Redis, along with its Sorted Set data structure, which provides $O(log (N))$ time complexity operation for the key-value pair dataset with efficiency and low latency, and maintains precision. The core contribution is quantifying the accuracy and memory cost trade-off of the chosen Rolling Window as the implemented rate limiting algorithm against the Token Bucket and Fixed Window algorithms. In addition, we explain how server-side Lua scripting is critical to bundling cleanup, counting, and insertion into a single atomic operation, thereby eliminating race conditions in concurrent environments. In the system architecture, we propose a three-layer architecture that manages the storage and updating of the limit rules. Through script load by hashing the rule parameters, rules can be changed without modifying the cached scripts. Furthermore, we analyze the deployment of this architecture on a Redis Cluster, which provides the availability and scalability by data sharding and replication. We explain the acceptance of AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) from the CAP theorem as the pragmatic engineering trade-off for this use case.

*Ramakant kumar*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: AUC-RAC is an auction-based mechanism for efficient computation task offloading among local servers in IoT environments using Docker swarm containerization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing resources and optimizing costs for computation-intensive task execution in cloud-based containerization for IoT remains challenging, despite distributed computing enabling cooperation between multiple devices.

Method: Proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism using Docker swarm with Manager Node and Worker Nodes. IoT devices send tasks to MN, which broadcasts task details to WNs for auction-based bidding, optimizing task allocation based on resource sufficiency.

Result: Experimental analysis shows the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.

Conclusion: AUC-RAC provides an effective auction-based solution for efficient task offloading in IoT environments using Docker containerization and swarm architecture.

Abstract: Distributed computing has enabled cooperation between multiple computing devices for the simultaneous execution of resource-hungry tasks. Such execution also plays a pivotal role in the parallel execution of numerous tasks in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. Leveraging the computing resources of multiple devices, the offloading and processing of computationintensive tasks can be carried out more efficiently. However, managing resources and optimizing costs remain challenging for successfully executing tasks in cloud-based containerization for IoT. This paper proposes AUC-RAC, an auction-based mechanism for efficient offloading of computation tasks among multiple local servers in the context of IoT devices. The approach leverages the concept of Docker swarm, which connects multiple local servers in the form of Manager Node (MN) and Worker Nodes (WNs). It uses Docker containerization to execute tasks simultaneously. In this system, IoT devices send tasks to the MN, which then sends the task details to all its WNs to participate in the auction-based bidding process. The auctionbased bidding process optimizes the allocation of computation tasks among multiple systems, considering their resource sufficiency. The experimental analysis establishes that the approach offers improved offloading and computation-intensive services for IoT devices by enabling cooperation between local servers.

Motivation: To explore the algorithmic implications of adding a global clock to Contention Resolution problems, which is technologically realistic but previously understudied, and to understand complexity gaps between different latency objectives.

Method: Designs new Contention Resolution protocols and analyzes complexity bounds using theoretical analysis, comparing protocols with global vs local clocks, and examining in-expectation vs with-high-probability latency metrics.

Result: [1] New protocol with latency O(n(log log n)^{1+o(1)}), establishing ~log n gap between global/local clock protocols. [2] Shows log n factor gap between in-expectation (Θ(n log n/log log n)) and with-high-probability (Θ(n log² n/log log n)) latencies. [3] Proves impossibility of simultaneously achieving optimal in-expectation and with-high-probability latencies.

Conclusion: Global clock assumption significantly impacts Contention Resolution complexity, creating meaningful gaps between different clock models and latency objectives, with fundamental trade-offs between in-expectation and with-high-probability performance.

Abstract: In the Contention Resolution problem $n$ parties each wish to have exclusive use of a shared resource for one unit of time. The problem has been studied since the early 1970s, under a variety of assumptions on feedback given to the parties, how the parties wake up, knowledge of $n$, and so on. The most consistent assumption is that parties do not have access to a global clock, only their local time since wake-up. This is surprising because the assumption of a global clock is both technologically realistic and algorithmically interesting. It enriches the problem, and opens the door to entirely new techniques. Our primary results are: [1] We design a new Contention Resolution protocol that guarantees latency $$O\left(\left(n\log\log n\log^{(3)} n\log^{(4)} n\cdots \log^{(\log^* n)} n\right)\cdot 2^{\log^* n}\right) \le n(\log\log n)^{1+o(1)}$$ in expectation and with high probability. This already establishes at least a roughly $\log n$ complexity gap between randomized protocols in GlobalClock and LocalClock. [2] Prior analyses of randomized ContentionResolution protocols in LocalClock guaranteed a certain latency with high probability, i.e., with probability $1-1/\text{poly}(n)$. We observe that it is just as natural to measure expected latency, and prove a $\log n$-factor complexity gap between the two objectives for memoryless protocols. The In-Expectation complexity is $Θ(n \log n/\log\log n)$ whereas the With-High-Probability latency is $Θ(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$. Three of these four upper and lower bounds are new. [3] Given the complexity separation above, one would naturally want a ContentionResolution protocol that is optimal under both the In-Expectation and With-High-Probability metrics. This is impossible! It is even impossible to achieve In-Expectation latency $o(n\log^2 n/(\log\log n)^2)$ and With-High-Probability latency $n\log^{O(1)} n$ simultaneously.

TL;DR: OServe is an LLM serving system that addresses spatial and temporal workload heterogeneity through flexible model deployment, achieving up to 2× performance improvement over state-of-the-art systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world LLM serving workloads exhibit substantial spatial heterogeneity (varying compute/memory demands across requests) and temporal heterogeneity (changing workload composition over time), but existing systems assume uniform, stable workloads with homogeneous static deployments, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: OServe introduces: 1) a workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments based on real-time workload characteristics, and 2) an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes.

Result: Experiments on real-world traces show OServe improves performance by up to 2× (average: 1.5×) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.

Conclusion: OServe effectively addresses spatial-temporal workload heterogeneity in LLM serving through flexible model deployment strategies, significantly outperforming existing homogeneous static deployment approaches.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) can benefit immensely from parallelizing both the model and input requests across multiple devices, but incoming workloads exhibit substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Spatially, workloads comprise heterogeneous requests with varying compute and memory demands. Temporally, workload composition varies over time. Nevertheless, existing systems typically assume spatially uniform and temporally stable workloads, employing a homogeneous, static model deployment. This mismatch between the assumption and real-world spatial-temporal heterogeneity results in suboptimal performance. We present OServe, an LLM serving system with heterogeneous and flexible model deployment that addresses both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. First, OServe introduces a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm that optimizes heterogeneous model deployments according to real-time workload characteristics. Second, OServe proposes an efficient workload-adaptive switching method that migrates model deployments in response to predicted workload changes. Experiments on real-world traces show that OServe improves performance by up to 2$\times$ (average: 1.5$\times$) compared to state-of-the-art serving systems.

### [16] [Bounded Local Generator Classes for Deterministic State Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11476)

Main category: cs.OS

TL;DR: Defines Bounded Local Generator Classes (BLGC) for deterministic graph operators with finite-range updates, proving constant per-step work independent of system size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize a constructive subclass of locality-preserving deterministic operators on graph-indexed state systems where computational effort scales independently of global system dimension.

Method: Define BLGC consisting of finite-range generators operating on bounded state spaces under deterministic composition, with Hilbert-space embedding in ℓ²(V; ℝ^d) and analysis of operator norms on admissible subspaces.

Result: Proves that under BLGC assumptions, per-step operator work satisfies W_t = O(1) as number of nodes M → ∞, establishing structural decoupling between global state size and incremental computational effort.

Conclusion: The framework provides a formal foundation for locality-preserving deterministic graph operators with bounded computational complexity, though limited to the defined subclass with locality and boundedness constraints.

Abstract: We formalize a constructive subclass of locality-preserving deterministic operators acting on graph-indexed state systems. We define the class of Bounded Local Generator Classes (BLGC), consisting of finite-range generators operating on bounded state spaces under deterministic composition. Within this class, incremental update cost is independent of total system dimension. We prove that, under the BLGC assumptions, per-step operator work satisfies W_t = O(1) as the number of nodes M \to \infty, establishing a structural decoupling between global state size and incremental computational effort. The framework admits a Hilbert-space embedding in \ell^2(V; \mathbb{R}^d) and yields bounded operator norms on admissible subspaces. The result applies specifically to the defined subclass and does not claim universality beyond the stated locality and boundedness constraints.
