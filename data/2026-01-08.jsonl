Deciding where and why to run each of those applications is a complex task. Therefore, different approaches have been adopted to make offloading decisions. In this work, we propose a decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to address the selection of computing locations. Unlike most existing work, we analyze it in a real testbed composed of various edge devices running the agent to determine where to execute each task. These devices are connected to a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) server and a Cloud server through 5G communications. We evaluate not only the agent's performance in meeting task requirements but also the implications of running this type of agent locally, assessing the trade-offs of training locally versus remotely in terms of latency and energy consumption."}

In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency of 2 message delays ($2Δ$) during fault-free, synchronous periods. However, such a fast path only works if there is no contention: concurrent contending requests can cause replicas to diverge if they receive conflicting requests in different orders, triggering costly recovery procedures.\n  In this work, we present Aspen, a leaderless BFT protocol that achieves a near-optimal latency of $2Δ+ \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ indicates a short waiting delay. Aspen removes the no-contention condition by utilizing a best-effort sequencing layer based on loosely synchronized clocks and network delay estimates. Aspen requires $n = 3f + 2p + 1$ replicas to cope with up to $f$ Byzantine nodes. The $2p$ extra nodes allow Aspen's fast path to proceed even if up to $p$ replicas diverge due to unpredictable network delays. When its optimistic conditions do not hold, Aspen falls back to PBFT-style protocol, guaranteeing safety and liveness under partial synchrony. In experiments with wide-area distributed replicas, Aspen commits requests in less than 75 ms, a 1.2 to 3.3$\\times$ improvement compared to previous protocols, while supporting 19,000 requests per second."}

A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irrevocably finalizes a prefix.\n  We present Majorum, an ebb-and-flow construction whose dynamically available component builds on a quorum-based protocol (TOB-SVD). Under optimistic conditions, Majorum finalizes blocks in as few as three slots while requiring only a single voting phase per slot. In particular, when conditions remain favourable, each slot finalizes the next block extending the previously finalized one."}

However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments."}

In this article, we introduce the FREEDA toolchain, designed to automate the failure-resilient and carbon-efficient deployment of MSAs over the Cloud-Edge Continuum.\n  The FREEDA toolchain continuously adapts deployment configurations to changing operational conditions, resource availability, and sustainability constraints, aiming to maintain the MSA quality and service continuity while reducing carbon emissions. We also introduce an experimental suite using diverse simulated and emulated scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the toolchain against real-world challenges, including resource exhaustion, node failures, and carbon intensity fluctuations. The results demonstrate FREEDA's capability to autonomously reconfigure deployments by migrating services, adjusting flavour selections, or rebalancing workloads, successfully achieving an optimal balance among resilience, efficiency, and environmental impact."}
