Current approaches often fail to provide a holistic view, making it\ndifficult to compare and optimise systems across heterogeneous hardware,\nsoftware stacks, and numeric precisions. To address this gap, we propose a\nunified and reproducible methodology for AI model inference that integrates\ncomputational and environmental metrics under realistic serving conditions. Our\nframework provides a pragmatic, carbon-aware evaluation by systematically\nmeasuring latency and throughput distributions, energy consumption, and\nlocation-adjusted carbon emissions, all while maintaining matched accuracy\nconstraints for valid comparisons. We apply this methodology to multi-precision\nmodels across diverse hardware platforms, from data-centre accelerators like\nthe GH200 to consumer-level GPUs such as the RTX 4090, running on mainstream\nsoftware stacks including PyTorch, TensorRT, and ONNX Runtime. By\nsystematically categorising these factors, our work establishes a rigorous\nbenchmarking framework that produces decision-ready Pareto frontiers,\nclarifying the trade-offs between accuracy, latency, energy, and carbon. The\naccompanying open-source code enables independent verification and facilitates\nadoption, empowering researchers and practitioners to make evidence-based\ndecisions for sustainable AI deployment."}

Federated learning approaches provide a\nmodel-aggregation mechanism among edge devices to achieve collaborative\ntraining, while ensuring data security, communication efficiency, and sharing\ncomputational overheads. On the other hand, limited transmission resources and\ncomplex communication environments remain significant bottlenecks to the\nefficient collaborations among edge devices, particularly within large-scale\nnetworks. To address such issues, this paper proposes an over-the-air (OTA)\nanalog aggregation method designed for the distributed swarm learning (DSL),\ntermed DSL-OTA, aiming to enhance communication efficiency, enable effective\ncooperation, and ensure privacy preserving. Incorporating multi-worker\nselection strategy with over-the-air aggregation not only makes the standard\nDSL based on single best worker contributing to global model update to become\nmore federated, but also secures the aggregation from potential risks of data\nleakage.
