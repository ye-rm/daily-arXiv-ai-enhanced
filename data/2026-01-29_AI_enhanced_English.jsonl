We propose a new paradigm for constructing priority encoders by generalizing the previously proposed two-level priority encoder structure. We extend this concept to three and four levels using two techniques -- cascading and composition -- and discuss further generalization.

Meanwhile, the tree and recursive designs are generally faster, but are more complex than the two-level and multi-level structures. We explore several characteristics and patterns of the designs across a wide range of input lengths.

As GPUs continue improving to satisfy ever-increasing performance demands, analyzing past and current progress becomes paramount in determining future constraints on scientific research. This is particularly compelling in the AI domain, where rapid technological advancements and fierce global competition have led the United States to recently implement export control regulations limiting international access to advanced AI chips. For this reason, this paper studies technical progress in NVIDIA datacenter GPUs released from the mid-2000s until today. Specifically, we compile a comprehensive dataset of datacenter NVIDIA GPUs comprising several features, ranging from computational performance to release price. Then, we examine trends in main GPU features and estimate progress indicators for per-memory bandwidth, per-dollar, and per-watt increase rates. Our main results identify doubling times of 1.44 and 1.69 years for FP16 and FP32 operations (without accounting for sparsity benefits), while FP64 doubling times range from 2.06 to 3.79 years. Off-chip memory size and bandwidth grew at slower rates than computing performance, doubling every 3.32 to 3.53 years. The release prices of datacenter GPUs have roughly doubled every 5.1 years, while their power consumption has approximately doubled every 16 years. Finally, we quantify the potential implications of current U.S. export control regulations in terms of the potential performance gaps that would result if implementation were assumed to be complete and successful. We find that recently proposed changes to export controls would shrink the potential performance gap from 23.6x to 3.54x.", "AI": {"tldr": "Analysis of NVIDIA datacenter GPU technical progress from mid-2000s to present, quantifying performance trends and estimating impact of US export controls on AI chip access.", "motivation": "GPUs are critical for AI and scientific computing, but rapid advancements and US export controls create uncertainty about future access to advanced AI chips.

However, the quadratic scaling complexity of attention poses significant challenges for efficient hardware implementation. While techniques such as quantization and pruning help mitigate this issue, selective token attention offers a promising alternative by narrowing the attention scope to only the most relevant tokens, reducing computation and filtering out noise.\n  In this work, we propose SATA, a locality-centric dynamic scheduling scheme that proactively manages sparsely distributed access patterns from selective Query-Key operations. By reordering operand flow and exploiting data locality, our approach enables early fetch and retirement of intermediate Query/Key vectors, improving system utilization. We implement and evaluate our token management strategy in a control and compute system, using runtime traces from selective-attention-based models.

Profiling on modern GPUs reveals that sampling can account for up to 70% of total model inference latency-primarily due to substantial memory loads and writes from vocabulary-wide logits, reduction-based token selection, and iterative masked updates. These processes demand large on-chip SRAM and involve irregular memory accesses that conventional NPUs struggle to handle efficiently. To address this, we identify a set of critical instructions that an NPU architecture must specifically optimize for dLLM sampling.
