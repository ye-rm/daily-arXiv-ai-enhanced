Data was divided\ninto two periods: pre-AI and post-AI. For PE-positive exams, TAT - defined as\nthe duration from patient scan completion to the first preliminary report\ncompletion - was compared between the two periods. Time-savings were reported\nseparately for work-hour and off-hour cohorts. To characterize radiologist\nworkflow, 527234 records were retrieved from the PACS and workflow parameters\nsuch as exam inter-arrival time and radiologist read-time extracted. These\nparameters were input into a computational model to predict time-savings\nfollowing deployment of an AI-triage device and to study the impact of workflow\nparameters. Results: The pre-AI dataset included 4694 chest CTPA exams with\n13.3% being PE-positive. The post-AI dataset comprised 6558 exams with 16.2%\nbeing PE-positive. The mean TAT for pre-AI and post-AI during work hours are\n68.9 [95% CI\" 55.0, 82.8] and 46.7 [38.1, 55.2] minutes respectively, and those\nduring off-hours are 44.8 [33.7, 55.9] and 42.0 [33.6, 50.3] minutes.\nClinically-observed time-savings during work hours (22.2 [95% CI: 5.85, 38.6]\nminutes) were significant (p=0.004), while off-hour (2.82 [-11.1, 16.7]\nminutes) were not (p=0.345). Observed time-savings aligned with model\npredictions (29.6 [95% range: 23.2, 38.1] minutes for work hours; 2.10 [1.76,\n2.58] minutes for off-hours). Discussion: Consideration and quantification of\nclinical workflow contribute to an accurate assessment of the expected\ntime-savings in TAT following deployment of an AI-triage device."}

We present Hive hash table, a\nhigh-performance, warp-cooperative and dynamically resizable GPU hash table\nthat adapts to varying workloads without global rehashing.\n  Hive hash table makes three key contributions. First, a cache-aligned packed\nbucket layout stores key-value pairs as 64-bit words, enabling coalesced memory\naccess and atomic updates via single-CAS operations. Second, warp-synchronous\nconcurrency protocols - Warp-Aggregated-Bitmask-Claim (WABC) and\nWarp-Cooperative Match-and-Elect (WCME) - reduce contention to one atomic\noperation per warp while ensuring lock-free progress. Third, a\nload-factor-aware dynamic resizing strategy expands or contracts capacity in\nwarp-parallel K-bucket batches using linear hashing, maintaining balanced\noccupancy. To handle insertions under heavy contention, Hive hash table employs\na four-step strategy: replace, claim-and-commit, bounded cuckoo eviction, and\noverflow-stash fallback. This design provides lock-free fast paths and bounded\nrecovery cost under contention determined by a fixed eviction depth, while\neliminating ABA hazards during concurrent updates.\n  Experimental evaluation on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 shows Hive hash table sustains\nload factors up to 95% while delivering 1.5-2x higher throughput than\nstate-of-the-art GPU hash tables (Slab-Hash, DyCuckoo, WarpCore) under mixed\ninsert-delete-lookup workloads. On balanced workload, Hive hash table reaches\n3.5 billion updates/s and nearly 4 billion lookups/s, demonstrating scalability\nand efficiency for GPU-accelerated data processing."}

Current parallel execution frameworks either\nrely on optimistic concurrency control (OCC) or on pessimistic concurrency\ncontrol (PCC), both of which see their performance decrease when workloads are\nhighly contended, albeit for different reasons. In this work, we present NEMO,\na new blockchain execution engine that combines OCC with the object data model\nto address this challenge. NEMO introduces four core innovations: (i) a greedy\ncommit rule for transactions using only owned objects; (ii) refined handling of\ndependencies to reduce re-executions; (iii) the use of incomplete but\nstatically derivable read/write hints to guide execution; and (iv) a\npriority-based scheduler that favors transactions that unblock others. Through\nsimulated execution experiments, we demonstrate that NEMO significantly reduces\nredundant computation and achieves higher throughput than representative\napproaches. For example, with 16 workers NEMO's throughput is up to 42% higher\nthan the one of Block-STM, the state-of-the-art OCC approach, and 61% higher\nthan the pessimistic concurrency control baseline used."}

The pay-as-you-go cost model of these cloud resources has\nnecessitated the development of specialized programming models and schedulers\nfor HPC jobs for efficient utilization of cloud resources. A key aspect of\nefficient utilization is the ability to rescale applications on the fly to\nmaximize the utilization of cloud resources. Most commonly used parallel\nprogramming models like MPI have traditionally not supported autoscaling either\nin a cloud environment or on supercomputers. While more recent work has been\ndone to implement this functionality in MPI, it is still nascent and requires\nadditional programmer effort. Charm++ is a parallel programming model that\nnatively supports dynamic rescaling through its migratable objects paradigm. In\nthis paper, we present a Kubernetes operator to run Charm++ applications on a\nKubernetes cluster. We then present a priority-based elastic job scheduler that\ncan dynamically rescale jobs based on the state of a Kubernetes cluster to\nmaximize cluster utilization while minimizing response time for high-priority\njobs.

We present\nresults for a general class of simple local balancing schemes where the tokens\nare balanced via matchings. In each round the process averages the tokens of\nany two matched nodes. If the sum of their tokens is odd, the node to receive\nthe one excess token is selected at random. Our class covers three popular\nmodels: in the matching model a new matching is generated randomly in each\nround, in the balancing circuit model a fixed sequence of matchings is applied\nperiodically, and in the asynchronous model the load is balanced over a\nrandomly chosen edge.\n  We measure the quality of a load vector by its discrepancy, defined as the\ndifference between the maximum and minimum load across all nodes. As our main\nresult we show that with high probability our discrete balancing scheme reaches\na discrepancy of $3$ in a number of rounds which asymptotically matches the\nspectral bound for continuous load balancing with fractional load.\n  This result improves and tightens a long line of previous works, by not only\nachieving a small constant discrepancy (instead of a non-explicit, large\nconstant) but also holding for arbitrary instead of regular graphs.
