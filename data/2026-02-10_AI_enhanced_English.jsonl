In today's environment, it is crucial to develop light-weight mechanisms that recover a distributed system from faults quickly and with only a small impact on the live-system throughput. To address this need, this paper proposes a new low-overhead, general recovery scheme for modern non-transactional leaderless distributed systems. We call our scheme HEAL. On a node failure, HEAL performs an optimized online incremental recovery. This paper presents HEAL's algorithms for settings with Linearizable consistency and different memory persistency models. We implement HEAL on a 6-node Intel cluster. Our experiments running TAOBench workloads show that HEAL is very effective. HEAL recovers the cluster in 120 milliseconds on average, while reducing the throughput of the running workload by an average of 8.7%. In contrast, a conventional recovery scheme for leaderless systems needs 360 seconds to recover, reducing the throughput of the system by 16.2%. Finally, compared to an incremental recovery scheme for a state-of-the-art leader-based system, HEAL reduces the average recovery latency by 20.7x and the throughput degradation by 62.4%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEAL is a low-overhead recovery scheme for non-transactional leaderless distributed systems that performs optimized online incremental recovery with minimal throughput impact.", "motivation": "The need for lightweight recovery mechanisms in distributed systems that can recover from faults quickly with minimal impact on system throughput, especially for modern non-transactional leaderless systems.", "method": "Proposes HEAL, a general recovery scheme with algorithms for Linearizable consistency and different memory persistency models, performing optimized online incremental recovery on node failures.", "result": "HEAL recovers clusters in 120ms average with only 8.7% throughput reduction, compared to 360 seconds and 16.2% reduction for conventional leaderless recovery, and 20.7x faster recovery with 62.4% less throughput degradation than leader-based incremental recovery.", "conclusion": "HEAL is an effective low-overhead recovery scheme for modern non-transactional leaderless distributed systems, significantly outperforming both conventional leaderless recovery and state-of-the-art leader-based incremental recovery schemes."}}

Simultaneously, the popularity of Large-Language-Models (LLMs) drives the adoption of low-bit floating-point formats which prioritize dynamic range. However, the conventional direct-accumulation CIM accommodates floating-points by normalizing them to a shared widened fixed-point scale. Consequently, hardware resolution is dictated by the input's dynamic range rather than its precision, and energy consumption is dominated by the ADC. We address this limitation by introducing local normalization for each input, weight, and multiply-accumulate (MAC) output via a Gain-Ranging MAC (GR-MAC). Normalization overhead is handled by low-power digital logic, enabling the computationally expensive MAC operation to remain in the energy-efficient low-precision analog regime. Energy modelling shows that the addition of a gain-ranging Stage to the MAC enables a 4-bit increase in input dynamic range without increased energy consumption at a 35 dB SQNR standard. Additionally, the ADC resolution requirement becomes invariant to input distribution assumptions, allowing construction of an upper bound with a 1.5-bit reduction compared to the conventional lower bound.

To mitigate extensive request timeouts caused by accumulation, systems for inference pipelines commonly drop a subset of requests so the remaining ones can satisfy latency constraints. Since it is commonly believed that request dropping adversely affects goodput, existing systems only drop requests when they have to, which we call reactive dropping. However, this reactive policy can not maintain high goodput, as it neither makes timely dropping decisions nor identifies the proper set of requests to drop, leading to issues of dropping requests too late or dropping the wrong set of requests.\n  We propose that the inference system should proactively drop certain requests in advance to enhance the goodput across the entire workload. To achieve this, we design an inference system PARD. It enhances goodput with timely and precise dropping decisions by integrating a proactive dropping method that decides when to drop requests using runtime information of the inference pipeline, and an adaptive request priority mechanism that selects which specific requests to drop based on remaining latency budgets and workload intensity. Evaluation on a cluster of 64 GPUs over real-world workloads shows that PARD achieves $16\\%$-$176\\%$ higher goodput than the state of the art while reducing the drop rate and wasted computation resources by $1.6\\times$-$17\\times$ and $1.5\\times$-$62\\times$ respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "PARD is a proactive dropping system for DNN inference pipelines that improves goodput by making timely dropping decisions and selecting appropriate requests to drop based on runtime information and workload intensity.", "motivation": "Existing reactive dropping policies in DNN inference pipelines drop requests too late or choose wrong requests, leading to poor goodput.
