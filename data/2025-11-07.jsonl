This capability has been shown to reduce workload\nmakespan, substantially decrease job waiting times and improve overall system\nutilization. In this context, malleability refers to the ability of\napplications to adapt to new resource allocations during execution. Although\nbeneficial, malleability incurs significant reconfiguration costs, making the\nreduction of these costs an important research topic.\n  Some existing methods for MPI applications respawn the entire application,\nwhich is an expensive solution that avoids the reuse of original processes.\nOther MPI methods reuse them, but fail to fully release unneeded processes when\nshrinking, since some ranks within the same communicator remain active across\nnodes, preventing the application from returning those nodes to the system.\nThis work overcomes both limitations by proposing a novel parallel spawning\nstrategy, in which all processes cooperate in spawning before redistribution,\nthereby reducing execution time. Additionally, it removes shrinkage\nlimitations, allowing better adaptation of parallel systems to workload and\nreducing their makespan. As a result, it preserves competitive expansion times\nwith at most a $1.25\\times$ overhead, while enabling fast shrink operations\nthat reduce their cost by at least $20\\times$. This strategy has been validated\non both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems and can also be applied in\nshared-resource environments."}

Recent observations suggest that the internal\nactivations of LLMs are often dynamically sparse, meaning that for each input,\nonly part of the network contributes significantly to the output. Such sparsity\ncould reduce computation, but it interacts poorly with group-wise quantization,\nwhich remains the dominant approach for fitting LLMs onto resource-constrained\nhardware. To reconcile these two properties, this study proposes a set of\ntechniques that realize dynamic sparse inference under low-bit quantization.\nThe method features: (1) a zigzag-patterned quantization layout that organizes\nweights in a way consistent with activation sparsity and improves GPU memory\nlocality; (2) a specialized GEMV kernel designed for this layout to fully\nutilize parallel compute units; and (3) a compact runtime mechanism that\ngathers sparse indices with minimal overhead. Across several model scales and\nhardware configurations, the approach achieves up to 1.55x faster decoding\nthroughput while maintaining accuracy comparable to dense quantized inference,\nshowing that structured sparsity and quantization can effectively coexist on\ncommodity GPUs."}

Subsequent revisits to the rule largely\nretained that economics-only view, leaving host costs, feasibility limits, and\nworkload behavior out of scope. This paper revisits the rule from first\nprinciples, integrating host costs, DRAM bandwidth/capacity, and\nphysics-grounded models of SSD performance and cost, and then embedding these\nelements in a constraint- and workload-aware framework that yields actionable\nprovisioning guidance. We show that, for modern AI platforms, especially\nGPU-centric hosts paired with ultra-high-IOPS SSDs engineered for fine-grained\nrandom access, the DRAM-to-flash caching threshold collapses from minutes to a\nfew seconds. This shift reframes NAND flash memory as an active data tier and\nexposes a broad research space across the hardware-software stack. We further\nintroduce MQSim-Next, a calibrated SSD simulator that supports validation and\nsensitivity analysis and facilitates future architectural and system research.\nFinally, we present two concrete case studies that showcase the software system\ndesign space opened by such memory hierarchy paradigm shift.

Conventional\ncircuit-level IR-drop mitigation methods, such as back-end optimizations, are\nresource-intensive and often compromise power, performance, and area (PPA). To\naddress these challenges, we propose AIM, comprehensive software and hardware\nco-design for architecture-level IR-drop mitigation in high-performance PIM.\nInitially, leveraging the bit-serial and in-situ dataflow processing properties\nof PIM, we introduce Rtog and HR, which establish a direct correlation between\nPIM workloads and IR-drop. Building on this foundation, we propose LHR and WDS,\nenabling extensive exploration of architecture-level IR-drop mitigation while\nmaintaining computational accuracy through software optimization.
