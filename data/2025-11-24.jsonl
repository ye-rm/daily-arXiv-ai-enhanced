Kulkarni"], "title": "Vorion: A RISC-V GPU with Hardware-Accelerated 3D Gaussian Rendering and Training", "comment": null, "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a foundational technique for real-time neural rendering, 3D scene generation, volumetric video (4D) capture. However, its rendering and training impose massive computation, making real-time rendering on edge devices and real-time 4D reconstruction on workstations currently infeasible. Given its fixed-function nature and similarity with traditional rasterization, 3DGS presents a strong case for dedicated hardware in the graphics pipeline of next-generation GPUs. This work, Vorion, presents the first GPGPU prototype with hardware-accelerated 3DGS rendering and training. Vorion features scalable architecture, minimal hardware change to traditional rasterizers, z-tiling to increase parallelism, and Gaussian/pixel-centric hybrid dataflow. We prototype the minimal system (8 SIMT cores, 2 Gaussian rasterizer) using TSMC 16nm FinFET technology, which achieves 19 FPS for rendering. The scaled design with 16 rasterizers achieves 38.6 iterations/s for training."}

Although prior work exploits weight dependent MAC power for compression, existing methods often use global activation models, coarse energy proxies, or layer-agnostic policies, which limits their effectiveness on real hardware. We propose an energy aware, layer-wise compression framework that explicitly leverages MAC and layer level energy characteristics. First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint. Experiments on different CNN models demonstrate up to 58.6\\% energy reduction with 2-3\\% accuracy drop, outperforming a state-of-the-art power-aware baseline."}

This paper introduces NX-CGRA, a programmable hardware accelerator designed to support a range of transformer inference algorithms, including both linear and non-linear functions. Unlike fixed-function accelerators optimized for narrow use cases, NX-CGRA employs a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) architecture with software-driven programmability, enabling efficient execution across varied kernel patterns. The architecture is evaluated using representative benchmarks derived from real-world transformer models, demonstrating high overall efficiency and favorable energy-area tradeoffs across different classes of operations. These results indicate the potential of NX-CGRA as a scalable and adaptable hardware solution for edge transformer deployment under constrained power and silicon budgets."}

However, the dynamic nature of MoE leads to load imbalance among experts, severely impacting training efficiency. While previous research has attempted to address the load balancing challenge, existing solutions either compromise model accuracy or introduce additional system overhead. As a result, they fail to achieve fine-grained load balancing, which is crucial to optimizing training efficiency.\n  We propose MicroEP, a novel parallelization strategy to achieve fine-grained load balancing in MoE systems. MicroEP is capable of achieving optimal load balancing in every micro-batch through efficient token scheduling across GPUs. Furthermore, we propose MicroMoE, an efficient distributed MoE training system with MicroEP's load balancing capabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that MicroMoE improves the end-to-end training throughput by up to 47.6% compared with the state-of-the-art system, and almost consistently achieves optimal load balance among GPUs."}

On the architecture level, MemIntelli achieves flexible variable-precision IMC supporting integer and floating data representation with bit-slicing. Moreover, MemIntelli is compatible with NumPy and PyTorch for seamless integration with applications. To demonstrate its capabilities, diverse intelligent algorithms, such as equation solving, data clustering, wavelet transformation, and neural network training and inference, were employed to showcase the robust processing ability of MemIntelli.

Scaling actions triggered by an anomaly detector help achieve target latency at the cost of extra resource consumption. However, performance anomaly detectors make mistakes. This paper studies which characteristics of performance anomaly detection are important to optimize the trade-off between performance and cost. Using Stochastic Reward Nets, we model a Cloud service monitored by a performance anomaly detector. Using our model, we study the impact of detector characteristics, namely precision, recall and inspection frequency, on the average latency and resource consumption of the monitored service. Our results show that achieving a high precision and a high recall is not always necessary. If detection can be run frequently, a high precision is enough to obtain a good performance-to-cost trade-off, but if the detector is run infrequently, recall becomes the most important."}

A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service. Using SmartWatts, a monitoring system leveraging Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware interfaces, we empirically determine correlations between the bundler workload and its active power consumption."}
