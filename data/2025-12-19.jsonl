It is tailored for serverless scalable architectures and uses a log-based rollback recovery protocol. LOG.io supports a general programming model, accommodating non-deterministic operators, interactions with external systems, and arbitrary custom code. It is non-blocking, allowing failed operators to recover independently without interrupting other active operators, thereby leveraging data parallelization, and it facilitates dynamic scaling of operators during pipeline execution. Performance evaluations, conducted within the SAP Data Intelligence system, compare LOG.io with the Asynchronous Barrier Snapshotting (ABS) protocol, originally implemented in Flink. Our experiments show that when there are straggler operators in a data pipeline and the throughput of events is moderate (e.g., 1 event every 100 ms), LOG.io performs as well as ABS during normal processing and outperforms ABS during recovery. Otherwise, ABS performs better than LOG.io for both normal processing and recovery. However, we show that in these cases, data parallelization can largely reduce the overhead of LOG.io while ABS does not improve. Finally, we show that the overhead of data lineage capture, at the granularity of the event and between any two operators in a pipeline, is marginal, with less than 1.5% in all our experiments."}

Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x."}

Motivated by the demand for real-time situational awareness and intelligent operational maintenance, digital twin (DT) technology was initially regarded as a promising solution, owing to its capability to create virtual replicas and emulate physical system behaviors. However, in the context of SAGSIN, the high-fidelity, full-scale modeling paradigm inherent to conventional DTs encounters fundamental limitations, including prohibitive computational overhead, delayed model synchronization, and cross-system semantic gaps. To address these limitations, this survey paper proposes a novel twinning framework: goal-oriented semantic twin (GOST). Unlike DTs that pursue physical mirroring, GOST prioritizes ``utility'' over ``fidelity,'' leveraging semantic technologies and goal-oriented principles to construct lightweight, task-specific representations. This paper systematically articulates the GOST framework through three layers: knowledge-based semantics, data-driven semantics, and goal-oriented principles. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive tutorial on constructing GOST by detailing its core enabling technologies and introduce a multidimensional evaluation framework for GOST. We present a case study targeting collaborative tracking tasks in remote satellite-UAV networks, demonstrating that GOST significantly outperforms conventional DTs in timeliness of perceptual data and collaborative tracking. Finally, we outline research directions, establishing GOST as a transformative twinning paradigm to guide the development of SAGSIN."}

However, the data providers of this knowledge face a skewed tradeoff between income and risk: they receive little share of downstream value yet retain copyright and privacy liability, making them reluctant to contribute their assets to LLM services. Existing techniques do not offer a trustworthy and controllable way to use professional knowledge, because they keep providers in the dark and combine knowledge parameters with the underlying LLM backbone.\n  In this paper, we present PKUS, the Professional Knowledge Utilization System, which treats professional knowledge as a first-class, separable artifact. PKUS keeps the backbone model on GPUs and encodes each provider's contribution as a compact adapter that executes only inside an attested Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). A hardware-rooted lifecycle protocol, adapter pruning, multi-provider aggregation, and split-execution scheduling together make this design practical at serving time. On SST-2, MNLI, and SQuAD with GPT-2 Large and Llama-3.2-1B, PKUS preserves model utility, matching the accuracy and F1 of full fine-tuning and plain LoRA, while achieving the lowest per-request latency with 8.1-11.9x speedup over CPU-only TEE inference and naive CPU-GPU co-execution."}

Branch prediction is a pattern recognition problem that learns mappings between a context to the branch outcome. An accurate predictor reduces the number of instructions executed on the wrong path resulting in an improvement of performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we present a workload characterization methodology for branch prediction. We propose two new workload-driven branch prediction accuracy identifiers -- branch working set size and branch predictability. These parameters are highly correlated with misprediction rates of modern branch prediction schemes (e.g. TAGE and perceptron). We define the branch working set of a trace as a group of most frequently occurring branch contexts, i.e. the 3-part tuple of branch address, and associated global and local history. We analyze the branch working set's size and predictability on a per-trace basis to study its relationship with a modern branch predictor's accuracy. We have characterized 2,451 workload traces into seven branch working set size and nine predictability categories after analyzing their branch behavior. We present further insights into the source of prediction accuracy and favored workload categories for modern branch predictors."}

Artificial networks typically replicate this via recurrent or parallel architectures, yet incur high energy costs and noise sensitivity. Here we report IPNet, a hardware-software co-designed neuromorphic architecture realizing human-like working memory via neuronal intrinsic plasticity. Exploiting Joule-heating dynamics of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), IPNet physically emulates biological memory volatility. The memory behavior of the proposed architecture shows similar trends in n-back, free recall and memory interference tasks to that of reported human subjects. Implemented exclusively with MTJ neurons, the architecture with human-like working memory achieves 99.65% accuracy on 11-class DVS gesture datasets and maintains 99.48% on a novel 22-class time-reversed benchmark, outperforming RNN, LSTM, and 2+1D CNN baselines sharing identical backbones. For autonomous driving (DDD-20), IPNet reduces steering prediction error by 14.4% compared to ResNet-LSTM. Architecturally, we identify a 'Memory-at-the-Frontier' effect where performance is maximized at the sensing interface, validating a bio-plausible near-sensor processing paradigm. Crucially, all results rely on raw parameters from fabricated devices without optimization. Hardware-in-the-loop validation confirms the system's physical realizability. Separately, energy analysis reveals a reduction in memory power of 2,874x compared to LSTMs and 90,920x versus parallel 3D-CNNs. This capacitor-free design enables a compact ~1.5um2 footprint (28 nm CMOS): a >20-fold reduction over standard LIF neurons. Ultimately, we demonstrate that instantiating human-like working memory via intrinsic neuronal plasticity endows neural networks with the dual biological advantages of superior dynamic vision processing and minimal metabolic cost."}

Among sharing techniques, NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) offers strong resource isolation by enabling hardware-level GPU partitioning. However, leveraging MIG effectively introduces new challenges. First, resource contention persists due to shared components such as PCIe bandwidth. Second, GPU fragmentation becomes a critical issue, which is different from prior fine-grained GPU sharing work due to MIG's limited number of valid MIG configurations. Fragmentation arises not only from spatial discontinuity but also from rigid profile placement constraints, especially after job arrivals and terminations. To address these issues, we propose an online scheduling framework that integrates conditional load balancing, dynamic partitioning, and job migration. Our approach dynamically adapts job placement to minimize contention and reorganizes GPU allocations to combat both internal and external fragmentation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves system efficiency. When all techniques are applied, the makespan improves by up to 35%."}

This personal context, combined with advanced generative AI, will unlock a powerful new generation of contextual AI personal assistants and applications.

To understand how to guide design for such systems, this work provides the first complete system architecture view of one such wearable contextual AI system (Aria2), along with the lessons we have learned through the system modeling and design space exploration process. We show that an end-to-end full system model view of such systems is vitally important, as no single component or category overwhelmingly dominates system power. This means long-range design decisions and power optimizations need to be made in the full system context to avoid running into limits caused by other system bottlenecks (i.e., Amdahl's law as applied to power) or as bottlenecks change. Finally, we reflect on lessons and insights for the road ahead, which will be important toward eventually enabling all-day, wearable, contextual AI systems."}

This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified.

These \"setup times\" can wreak havoc on a system's queueing; this is especially true in modern systems, where servers are regularly turned on and off as a way to reduce operating costs (energy, labor, CO2, etc.). To design modern systems which are both efficient and performant, we need to understand how setup times affect queues.\n  Unfortunately, despite successes in understanding setup in a single-server system, setup in a multiserver system remains poorly understood. To circumvent the main difficulty in analyzing multiserver setup, all existing results assume that setup times are memoryless, i.e. distributed Exponentially. However, in most practical settings, setup times are close to Deterministic, and the widely used Exponential-setup assumption leads to unrealistic model behavior and a dramatic underestimation of the true harm caused by setup times.\n  This paper provides a comprehensive characterization of the average waiting time in a multiserver system with Deterministic setup times, the M/M/k/Setup-Deterministic. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the average waiting time in this system, and show these bounds are within a multiplicative constant of each other. These bounds are the first closed-form characterization of waiting time in any finite-server system with setup times. Further, we demonstrate how to combine our upper and lower bounds to derive a simple and accurate approximation for the average waiting time. These results are all made possible via a new technique for analyzing random time integrals that we named the Method of Intervening Stopping Times, or MIST."}

We identify that immediate request dispatching in such systems leads to severe in-engine queuing and parallelization bubbles, degrading Time-to-First-Token (TTFT). To address this, we propose Staggered Batch Scheduling (SBS), a mechanism that deliberately buffers requests to form optimal execution batches. This temporal decoupling eliminates internal queuing bubbles without compromising throughput. Furthermore, leveraging the scheduling window created by buffering, we introduce a Load-Aware Global Allocation strategy that balances computational load across DP units for both Prefill and Decode phases.

To ensure atomic and consistent data access on DM, distributed transaction systems have been adapted, where compute nodes (CNs) rely on one-sided RDMA operations to access remote data in memory nodes (MNs). However, we observe that in existing transaction systems, the RDMA network interface cards at MNs become a primary performance bottleneck. This bottleneck arises from the high volume of one-sided atomic operations used for locks, which hinders the system's ability to scale efficiently.\n  To address this issue, this paper presents Lotus, a scalable distributed transaction system with lock disaggregation on DM. The key innovation of Lotus is to disaggregate locks from data and execute all locks on CNs, thus eliminating the bottleneck at MN RNICs. To achieve efficient lock management on CNs, Lotus employs an application-aware lock management mechanism that leverages the locality of the OLTP workloads to shard locks while maintaining load balance. To ensure consistent transaction processing with lock disaggregation, Lotus introduces a lock-first transaction protocol, which separates the locking phase as the first step in each read-write transaction execution. This protocol allows the system to determine the success of lock acquisitions early and proactively abort conflicting transactions, improving overall efficiency. To tolerate lock loss during CN failures, Lotus employs a lock-rebuild-free recovery mechanism that treats locks as ephemeral and avoids their reconstruction, ensuring lightweight recovery for CN failures. Experimental results demonstrate that Lotus improves transaction throughput by up to 2.1$\\times$ and reduces latency by up to 49.4% compared to state-of-the-art transaction systems on DM."}

To address these issues, we propose FlexKV, a memory-disaggregated KV store with index proxying. Our key idea is to dynamically offload the index to compute nodes, leveraging their powerful CPUs to accelerate index processing and maintain high-performance compute-side caches. Three challenges have to be addressed to enable efficient index proxying on DM, i.e., the load imbalance across compute nodes, the limited memory of compute nodes, and the expensive cache coherence overhead.

More precisely, the problem considers two key decisions: (i) whether to deploy additional edge servers or upgrade those already installed, and (ii) how tasks should be offloaded so that the average number of tasks that meet their delay requirement is maximized. The framework specifically involves: (i) deployment of new servers combined with capacity upgrades for existing servers, and (ii) the optimal task offloading to maximize the average number of tasks with a delay requirement. It also considers the following constraints: (i) budget per stage, (ii) server deployment and upgrade cost (in $) and cost depreciation rate, (iii) computation resource of servers, (iv) number of tasks and their growth rate (in %), and (v) the increase in task sizes and stricter delay requirements over time. We present two solutions: a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and an efficient heuristic algorithm (M-ESU/H). MILP yields the optimal solution for small networks, whereas M-ESU/H is used in large-scale networks. For small networks, the simulation results show that the solution computed by M-ESU/H is within 1.25% of the optimal solution while running several orders of magnitude faster. For large networks, M-ESU/H is compared against three alternative heuristic solutions that consider only server deployment, or giving priority to server deployment or upgrade.
