Eltawil", "Khaled Nabil Salama"], "title": "Sparsity-Aware Streaming SNN Accelerator with Output-Channel Dataflow for Automatic Modulation Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies, including 5G, emerging 6G networks, and the large-scale deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), has intensified the need for efficient spectrum utilization. Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in cognitive radio systems by enabling real-time identification of modulation schemes for dynamic spectrum access and interference mitigation. While deep neural networks (DNNs) offer high classification accuracy, their computational and energy demands pose challenges for real-time edge deployment. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature, offer inherent energy efficiency, but achieving both high throughput and low power under constrained hardware resources remains challenging. This work proposes a sparsity-aware SNN streaming accelerator optimized for AMC tasks. Unlike traditional systolic arrays that exploit sparsity but suffer from low throughput, or streaming architectures that achieve high throughput but cannot fully utilize input and weight sparsity, our design integrates both advantages. By leveraging the fixed nature of kernels during inference, we apply the gated one-to-all product (GOAP) algorithm to compute only on non-zero input-weight intersections. Extra or empty iterations are precomputed and embedded into the inference dataflow, eliminating dynamic data fetches and enabling fully pipelined, control-free inter-layer execution. Implemented on an FPGA, our sparsity-aware output-channel dataflow streaming (SAOCDS) accelerator achieves 23.5 MS/s (approximately double the baseline throughput) on the RadioML 2016 dataset, while reducing dynamic power and maintaining comparable classification accuracy. These results demonstrate strong potential for real-time, low-power deployment in edge cognitive radio systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "A sparsity-aware SNN streaming accelerator for automatic modulation classification achieves 23.5 MS/s throughput (double baseline) with reduced power on FPGA, enabling real-time edge deployment.", "motivation": "The need for efficient spectrum utilization in 5G/6G/IoT systems requires real-time AMC for cognitive radio, but DNNs have high computational/energy demands for edge deployment, while SNNs offer energy efficiency but struggle with throughput-power tradeoffs under hardware constraints.", "method": "Proposes a sparsity-aware SNN streaming accelerator using gated one-to-all product (GOAP) algorithm to compute only non-zero input-weight intersections, precomputing extra/empty iterations into dataflow to eliminate dynamic fetches and enable fully pipelined, control-free execution.", "result": "FPGA implementation achieves 23.5 MS/s throughput (approximately double baseline) on RadioML 2016 dataset while reducing dynamic power and maintaining comparable classification accuracy.", "conclusion": "The SAOCDS accelerator demonstrates strong potential for real-time, low-power deployment in edge cognitive radio systems by integrating advantages of sparsity exploitation and high throughput streaming architectures."}}
