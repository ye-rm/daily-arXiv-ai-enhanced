Data processing units (DPUs) enhance server network and storage performance but face challenges such as long hardware upgrade cycles and limited resources. To address these, we propose Taiji, a resource-elasticity architecture for DPUs. Combining hybrid virtualization with parallel memory swapping, Taiji switches the DPU's operating system (OS) into a guest OS and inserts a lightweight virtualization layer, making nearly all DPU memory swappable. It achieves memory overcommitment for the switched guest OS via high-performance memory elasticity, fully transparent to upper-layer applications, and supports hot-switch and hot-upgrade to meet in-production cloud requirements. Experiments show that Taiji expands DPU memory resources by over 50%, maintains virtualization overhead around 5%, and ensures 90% of swap-ins complete within 10 microseconds. Taiji delivers an efficient, reliable, low-overhead elasticity solution for DPUs and is deployed in large-scale production systems across more than 30,000 servers."}

However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS."}

Unfortunately, the time the CPU spends on setup control and synchronization has increased with growing accelerator complexity. For systems with complex accelerators, this means that performance can be configuration-bound. Faster accelerators are more severely impacted by this overlooked performance drop, which we call the configuration wall. Prior work evidences this wall and proposes ad-hoc solutions to reduce configuration overhead. However, these solutions are not universally applicable, nor do they offer comprehensive insights into the underlying causes of performance degradation. In this work, we first introduce a widely-applicable variant of the well-known roofline model to quantify when system performance is configuration-bound. To move systems out of the performance-bound region, we subsequently propose a domain-specific compiler abstraction and associated optimization passes. We implement the abstraction and passes in the MLIR compiler framework to run optimized binaries on open-source architectures to prove its effectiveness and generality. Experiments demonstrate a geomean performance boost of 2x on the open-source OpenGeMM system, by eliminating redundant configuration cycles and by automatically hiding the remaining configuration cycles. Our work provides key insights in how accelerator performance is affected by setup mechanisms, thereby facilitating automatic code generation for circumventing the configuration wall."}

Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process."}

We investigate the efficient scheduling of transactions in a network of fog-cloud computing model, where transactions and their associated shared objects can move within the network. The schedule may require objects to move to transaction nodes, or the transactions to move to the object nodes. Moreover, the schedule may determine intermediate nodes where both objects and transactions meet. Our goal is to minimize the total combined cost of the schedule. We focus on networks of constant doubling dimension, which appear frequently in practice. We consider a batch problem where an arbitrary set of nodes has transactions that need to be scheduled. First, we consider a single shared object required by all the transactions and present a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(\\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation of the optimal schedule, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $D$ is the diameter of the network. Later, we consider transactions accessing multiple shared objects (at most $k$ objects per transaction) and provide a scheduling algorithm that gives an $O(k \\cdot \\log n \\cdot \\log D)$ approximation. We also provide a fully distributed version of the scheduling algorithms where the nodes do not need global knowledge of transactions."}

We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs.

Traditional manual tuning methods incur prohibitive trial-and-error costs, and existing performance modeling approaches exhibit critical limitations: they fail to comprehensively account for prevalent optimization features and ignore the substantial overhead imposed by essential fault tolerance mechanisms like checkpoint recovery in long-duration pretraining. To address these gaps, we propose MoFa, a novel pretraining performance modeling framework that unifies multi-dimensional optimization features and fault tolerance. MoFa incorporates an enhanced cost model to accurately capture the effects of key optimizations and integrates a fault tolerance model based on historical cluster reliability data. Besides, a MoFa-based tuning system is developed to explore optimal pretraining performance and potential bottlenecks in various scenarios. Extensive modeling evaluations demonstrate that MoFa can achieve high prediction accuracy across various scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive tuning experiments, our framework systematically reveals the key factors influencing pretraining performance under different configurations, which provides solid a priori guidance for LLM pretraining system design and deployment."}
