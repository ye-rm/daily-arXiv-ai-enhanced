By performing\ninference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud,\nensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity.\nHowever, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly\nwith managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving.\nAs the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with\nthe sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access\ncosts. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational\npower, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed\nfor LLM inference.\n  To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using\nembedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device,\nwhich offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data\nintegrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive.\nTo reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we\npropose~\\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for\ndeploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained\nmemory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the\n\\textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\\times$ speedup and $4.5\\times$\nenergy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Kelle is a software-hardware co-design solution that uses embedded DRAM (eDRAM) for KV cache storage in edge devices running LLMs, achieving 3.9\u00d7 speedup and 4.5\u00d7 energy savings through optimized memory management.", "motivation": "Running LLMs on edge devices reduces latency and improves privacy but faces challenges with KV cache memory requirements.
