Finally we compare the results of simulation of the new\nframework with previous ones. In FIDRS framework, the technique of\nheterogeneous distributed data base is used to improve Performance and speed in\nresponding to users and in this way we can improve dependability and\nreliability of framework simultaneously. In extraction phase of the new\nframework we have used RMSD algorithm that decreases responding time in big\ndatabase. Finally by using FDIRS framework we succeeded to increase Efficiency,\nPerformance and reliability of integrated systems and remove some of previous\nframeworks problems."}

Conference: IEEE JCC 2025, 16th IEEE\n  International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing, Tucson, Arizona, USA, from\n  July 21 to 24, 2025", "summary": "As microservice-based systems scale across the cloud-edge continuum,\ntraditional centralized scheduling mechanisms increasingly struggle with\nlatency, coordination overhead, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a new\narchitectural direction: leveraging service mesh sidecar proxies as\ndecentralized, in-situ schedulers to enable scalable, low-latency coordination\nin large-scale, cloud-native environments. We propose embedding lightweight,\nautonomous scheduling logic into each sidecar, allowing scheduling decisions to\nbe made locally without centralized control. This approach leverages the\ngrowing maturity of service mesh infrastructures, which support programmable\ndistributed traffic management. We describe the design of such an architecture\nand present initial results demonstrating its scalability potential in terms of\nresponse time and latency under varying request rates. Rather than delivering a\nfinalized scheduling algorithm, this paper presents a system-level\narchitectural direction and preliminary evidence to support its scalability\npotential."}

Today's LLMs with billions of parameters are so huge that\nhardly any single computing node can train, fine-tune, or infer from them.\nTherefore, several distributed computing techniques are being introduced in the\nliterature to properly utilize LLMs. We have explored the application of\ndistributed computing techniques in LLMs from two angles.\n  \\begin{itemize}\n  \\item We study the techniques that democratize the LLM, that is, how large\nmodels can be run on consumer-grade computers.

We propose a\nfully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local\nknowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive,\ncommunication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the\nprotocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized\nand decentralized baselines.
