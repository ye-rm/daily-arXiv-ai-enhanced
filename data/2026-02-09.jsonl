This work introduces QEIL, Quantifying Edge Intelligence via Inference time Scaling Laws, a unified framework for efficient local LLM inference using principled scaling laws and heterogeneous orchestration across CPU, GPU, and NPU accelerators. We derive five architecture agnostic theorems that characterize how inference efficiency scales with model size, sample budget, and device level constraints. QEIL integrates three optimization dimensions. First, inference time scaling laws show that heterogeneous workload distribution achieves superlinear efficiency gains that are not observed in homogeneous execution. Second, hardware aware routing is enabled through analytical cost models that account for compute throughput, memory bandwidth, power consumption, and thermal limits. Third, performance energy trade offs are quantified using novel metrics including Intelligence Per Watt, Energy Coverage Efficiency, and Price Power Performance. A unified orchestrator combines these components through progressive sample multiplexing to improve coverage. Extensive evaluation across five model families from 125M to 2.6B parameters demonstrates consistent gains, including 7 to 10.5 percentage point improvement in pass at k coverage, 35.6 to 78.2 percent energy reduction, 68 percent average power reduction enabling edge thermal budgets, 15.8 percent latency improvement, and zero accuracy loss. Results confirm that inference time scaling laws are universal and architecture agnostic, establishing heterogeneous edge orchestration as the optimal strategy for energy constrained intelligent systems."}

Our work introduces a set of hardware-aware techniques. For prefill, we introduce an efficient dequantization engine, optimize tiled matrix multiplication kernels, and propose FlowQKV, a chunked, pipelined attention mechanism. For decoding, we introduce FusedDQP, which fuses dequantization and projection into a single kernel, and FlowKV, which re-structures attention to sustain high memory bandwidth utilization. Together with a compact Q4NX 4-bit quantization format, these methods yield up to $5.2\\times$ faster prefill and $4.8\\times$ faster decoding versus the iGPU, and $33.5\\times$ and $2.2\\times$ over the CPU, respectively. Power efficiency improves by as much as $67.2\\times$ and $222.9\\times$ compared to the iGPU and CPU.

This paper introduces the Hybrid Quantization and Pruning (HQP) framework, a novel, integrated methodology designed to achieve synergistic model acceleration while adhering to strict quality guarantees. We detail a sensitivity-aware structural pruning algorithm that employs a dynamic weight sensitivity metric, derived from a highly efficient approximation of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), to guide the iterative removal of redundant filters. This pruning is strictly conditional, enforcing an adherence to a maximum permissible accuracy drop (Delta ax) before the model proceeds to 8-bit post-training quantization. This rigorous coordination is critical, as it ensures the resultant sparse model structure is maximally robust to quantization error and hardware-specific kernel optimization. Exhaustive evaluation across heterogeneous NVIDIA Jetson edge platforms, utilizing resource-efficient architectures like MobileNetV3 and ResNet-18, demonstrates that the HQP framework achieves a peak performance gain of 3.12 times inference speedup and a 55 percent model size reduction, while rigorously containing the accuracy drop below the 1.5 percent constraint. A comprehensive comparative analysis against conventional single-objective compression techniques validates the HQP framework as a superior, hardware-agnostic solution for deploying ultra-low-latency AI in resource-limited edge infrastructures."}

Quantized LLMs offer significant advantages with extremely quantized models, motivating the development of specialized architectures to accelerate their workloads. This paper proposes D-Legion, a novel scalable many-core architecture, designed using many adaptive-precision systolic array cores, to accelerate matrix multiplication in quantized LLMs. The proposed architecture consists of a set of Legions where each Legion has a group of adaptive-precision systolic arrays. D-Legion supports multiple computation modes, including quantized sparse and dense matrix multiplications. The block structured sparsity is exploited within a fully-sparse, or partially-sparse windows. In addition, memory accesses of partial summations (psums) are spatially reduced through parallel accumulators. Furthermore, data reuse is maximized through optimized scheduling techniques by multicasting matrix tiles across the Legions. A comprehensive design space exploration is performed in terms of Legion/core granularity to determine the optimal Legion configuration. Moreover, D-Legion is evaluated on attention workloads from two BitNet models, delivering up to 8.2$\\times$ lower latency, up to 3.8$\\times$ higher memory savings, and up to 3$\\times$ higher psum memory savings compared to state-of-the-art work.

Their random sparsity, however, is at odds with efficient implementations on modern GPUs, since it leads to irregular memory access patterns that degrade memory bandwidth utilization. Motivated by this tension, we pursue a sketch-kernel co-design approach: we design a new family of sparse sketches, BlockPerm-SJLT, whose sparsity structure is chosen to enable FlashSketch, a corresponding optimized CUDA kernel that implements these sketches efficiently. The design of BlockPerm-SJLT introduces a tunable parameter that explicitly trades off the tension between GPU-efficiency and sketching robustness. We provide theoretical guarantees for BlockPerm-SJLT under the oblivious subspace embedding (OSE) framework, and also analyze the effect of the tunable parameter on sketching quality. We empirically evaluate FlashSketch on standard RandNLA benchmarks, as well as an end-to-end ML data attribution pipeline called GraSS. FlashSketch pushes the Pareto frontier of sketching quality versus speed, across a range of regimes and tasks, and achieves a global geomean speedup of roughly 1.7x over the prior state-of-the-art GPU sketches."}

While prior advances optimize attention execution for individual requests (e.g., FlashAttention), production LLM serving relies on batching requests with highly heterogeneous sequence lengths for high serving throughput. This mismatch induces severe computation and I/O imbalance, exacerbates stragglers, and underutilizes GPU resources. We present PackInfer, a kernel-level attention framework that enables compute- and I/O-aware execution for heterogeneous batched inference. PackInfer orchestrates batched requests into load-balanced execution groups, effectively saturating GPU utilization by packing multiple requests into unified kernel launches. By constructing attention kernels directly over packed query-key regions, PackInfer eliminates redundant computation and balances thread-block execution. It then incorporates I/O-aware grouping that co-locates shared-prefix requests and reorganizes KV caches into group-contiguous layouts, reducing memory fragmentation and redundant data movement as generation evolves. Evaluations on real-world workloads show that PackInfer reduces inference latency by 13.0-20.1%, and improves throughput by 20% compared to the state-of-the-art FlashAttention."}

While caching has been widely explored in web performance optimization literature, there is a lack of experimental work that explores the effect of simple inmemory caching in small-scale web applications. This paper fills this research gap by experimentally comparing the performance of two server-side web application configurations: one without caching and another with in-memory caching and a fixed time-tolive. The performance evaluation was conducted using a lightweight web server framework, and response times were measured using repeated HTTP requests under identical environmental conditions. The results show a significant reduction in response time for cached requests, and the findings of this paper provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of simple server-side caching in improving web application performance making it suitable for educational environments and small-scale web applications where simplicity and reproducibility are critical."}

While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%. In our commodity cluster setup, FCDP achieves up to 100x higher throughput than ZeRO-3 and 51x higher than ZeRO++, while maintaining ZeRO-3's maximum batch size."}

Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work."}

The framework couples a reusable farm template with a Gymnasium-based monitoring and control layer that exposes queue, timing, and QoS metrics to both reactive and learning-based controllers. We investigate the effectiveness of AI-driven dynamic scaling for managing the farm's degree of parallelism via the scalability of serverless functions on OpenFaaS.
