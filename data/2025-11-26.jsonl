Consequently, memory competition leads to inevitable page swapping in memory-constrained mixed-criticality edge devices, causing slow storage I/O and thus performance degradation. In such scenarios, inefficient memory allocation disrupts the balance between application performance, causing soft real-time (soft RT) tasks to miss deadlines or preventing non-real-time (non-RT) applications from optimizing throughput. Meanwhile, we observe unpredictable, long system-level stalls (called long stalls) under high memory and I/O pressure, which further degrade performance. In this work, we propose a Stall-Aware Real-Time Memory Allocator (SARA), which discovers opportunities for performance balance by allocating just enough memory to soft RT tasks to meet deadlines and, at the same time, optimizing the remaining memory for non-RT applications. To minimize the memory usage of soft RT tasks while meeting real-time requirements, SARA leverages our insight into how latency, caused by memory insufficiency and measured by our proposed PSI-based metric, affects the execution time of each soft RT job, where a job runs per period and a soft RT task consists of multiple periods. Moreover, SARA detects long stalls using our definition and proactively drops affected jobs, minimizing stalls in task execution. Experiments show that SARA achieves an average of 97.13% deadline hit ratio for soft RT tasks and improves non-RT application throughput by up to 22.32x over existing approaches, even with memory capacity limited to 60% of peak demand."}

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) offers a pathway by coordinating multiple QPUs to execute large-scale circuits. Yet, DQC still faces practical barriers, as its realization depends on advances in hardware-level components such as quantum transducers and high-fidelity entanglement-distribution modules. While these technologies continue to improve, mature DQC platforms remain unavailable. In the meantime, researchers need to assess the benefits of DQC and evaluate emerging DQC designs, but the software ecosystem lacks a circuit-level simulator that models heterogeneous backends, noisy connections, and distributed execution. To fill this gap, this paper proposes SimDisQ, the first end-to-end circuit-level DQC simulator, composed of a set of novel DQC-oriented automated simulation toolkits and communication noise models that can interoperate with existing toolkits in mainstream quantum software ecosystems. Leveraging circuit-level simulation capabilities, SimDisQ enables quantitative exploration of architectural design trade-offs, communication fidelity constraints, and new circuit optimization challenges introduced by DQC, providing a foundation for future research in this promising direction. Benchmarking experiments using SimDisQ respond to a couple of open questions in the community; for example, noisy simulation of superconducting and trapped-ion qubits, with a reasonable entanglement- distribution fidelity, reveal that heterogeneous QPUs can indeed yield higher execution fidelity."}

While large LLCs can reduce average memory access latency for workloads with a high degree of locality, they can also increase latency for workloads with irregular memory access patterns. Prefetchers are widely used to reduce memory latency by prefetching data into the cache hierarchy before it is accessed by the core. However, existing prediction-based prefetchers often struggle with irregular memory access patterns, which are especially prevalent in modern applications. This paper introduces the Pickle Prefetcher, a programmable and scalable LLC prefetcher designed to handle independent irregular memory access patterns effectively. Instead of relying on static heuristics or complex prediction algorithms, Pickle Prefetcher allows software to define its own prefetching strategies using a simple programming interface without expanding the instruction set architecture (ISA). By trading the logic complexity of hardware prediction for software programmability, Pickle Prefetcher can adapt to a wide range of access patterns without requiring extensive hardware resources for prediction. This allows the prefetcher to dedicate its resources to scheduling and issuing timely prefetch requests. Graph applications are an example where the memory access pattern is irregular but easily predictable by software. Through extensive evaluations of the Pickle Prefetcher on gem5 full-system simulations, we demonstrate tha Pickle Prefetcher significantly outperforms traditional prefetching techniques. Our results show that Pickle Prefetcher achieves speedups of up to 1.74x on the GAPBS breadth-first search (BFS) implementation over a baseline system. When combined with private cache prefetchers, Pickle Prefetcher provides up to a 1.40x speedup over systems using only private cache prefetchers."}

Although this approach improves throughput, static or heuristic shard allocation often leads to workload skew, congestion, and excessive cross-shard communication diminishing the scalability benefits of sharding. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Predictive Shard Allocation Protocol (PSAP), a dynamic and intelligent allocation framework that proactively assigns accounts and transactions to shards based on workload forecasts. PSAP integrates a Temporal Workload Forecasting (TWF) model with a safety-constrained reinforcement learning (Safe-PPO) controller, jointly enabling multi-block-ahead prediction and adaptive shard reconfiguration. The protocol enforces deterministic inference across validators through a synchronized quantized runtime and a safety gate that limits stake concentration, migration gas, and utilization thresholds. By anticipating hotspot formation and executing bounded, atomic migrations, PSAP achieves stable load balance while preserving Byzantine safety. Experimental evaluation on heterogeneous datasets, including Ethereum, NEAR, and Hyperledger Fabric mapped via address-clustering heuristics, demonstrates up to 2x throughput improvement, 35\\% lower latency, and 20\\% reduced cross-shard overhead compared to existing dynamic sharding baselines. These results confirm that predictive, deterministic, and security-aware shard allocation is a promising direction for next-generation scalable blockchain systems."}

Traditional automatic program repair (APR) methods define dedicated search spaces to locate and fix bugs with program synthesis. However, they heavily rely on fixed templates and can only deal with limited bugs. As an alternative, Large Language Models with the ability to understand code semantics can be explored for RTL repair. However, they suffer from unreliable outcomes due to inherent randomness and long input contexts of RTL code and waveform. To address these challenges, we propose R3A, an LLM-based automatic RTL program repair framework upon the basic model to improve reliability. R3A proposes the stochastic Tree-Of-Thoughts method to control a patch generation agent to explore a validated solution for the bug. The algorithm samples search states according to a heuristic function to balance between exploration and exploitation for a reliable outcome. Besides, R3A proposes a multi-agent fault localization method to find fault candidates as the starting points for the patch generation agent, further increasing the reliability. Experiments show R3A can fix 90.6% of bugs in the RTL-repair dataset within a given time limit, which covers 45% more bugs than traditional methods and other LLM-based approaches, while achieving an 86.7% pass@5 rate on average, showing a high reliability."}

However, workflow scheduling on HPC infrastructures remains challenging due to the prevalence of non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architectures. These systems require schedulers to account for data locality not only across distributed environments but also within each node. Modern HPC nodes integrate multiple NUMA domains and heterogeneous memory regions, such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM, and frequently attach accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) and network interface cards (NICs) to specific NUMA nodes. This design increases the variability of data-access latency and complicates the placement of both tasks and data. Despite these constraints, most workflow scheduling strategies were originally developed for Grid or Cloud environments and rarely incorporate NUMA-aware considerations. To address this gap, this work introduces nFlows, a NUMA-aware Workflow Execution Runtime System that enables the modeling, bare-metal execution, simulation, and validation of scheduling algorithms for data-intensive workflows on NUMA-based HPC systems. The system's design, implementation, and validation methodology are presented. nFlows supports the construction of simulation models and their direct execution on physical systems, enabling studies of NUMA effects on scheduling, the design of NUMA-aware algorithms, the analysis of data-movement behavior, the identification of performance bottlenecks, and the exploration of in-memory workflow execution."}

This improves upon the best-known complexity results in the literature over the same model. In addition, as natural by-products of our methodology, our algorithms also construct a spanning tree and elect a unique leader in $O(n)$ rounds, which are also important results of independent interest in the mobile-agent framework."}

While cloud-native RDBMSs provide elastic computing resources via disaggregated computing and storage, storage costs remain a critical user concern. Consequently, data compression emerges as an effective strategy to reduce storage costs. However, existing compression approaches in RDBMSs present a stark trade-off: software-based approaches incur significant performance overheads, while hardware-based alternatives lack the flexibility required for diverse database workloads. In this paper, we present PolarStore, a compressed shared storage system for cloud-native RDBMSs. PolarStore employs a dual-layer compression mechanism that combines in-storage compression in PolarCSD hardware with lightweight compression in software. This design leverages the strengths of both approaches. PolarStore also incorporates database-oriented optimizations to maintain high performance on critical I/O paths. Drawing from large-scale deployment experiences, we also introduce hardware improvements for PolarCSD to ensure host-level stability and propose a compression-aware scheduling scheme to improve cluster-level space efficiency. PolarStore is currently deployed on thousands of storage servers within PolarDB, managing over 100 PB of data. It achieves a compression ratio of 3.55 and reduces storage costs by approximately 60%. Remarkably, these savings are achieved while maintaining performance comparable to uncompressed clusters."}

It buffers in-flight metadata updates in programmable switches to enable data visibility in the network and retain strong consistency. SwitchDelta uses a best-effort data plane design to overcome the resource limitation of switches and designs a novel metadata update protocol to exploit the benefits of in-network data visibility. We evaluate SwitchDelta in three distributed in-memory storage systems: log-structured key-value stores, file systems, and secondary indexes. The evaluation shows that SwitchDelta reduces the latency of write operations by up to 52.4% and boosts the throughput by up to 126.9% under write-heavy workloads."}

While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup."}

Although high-bandwidth memory (HBM) on GPUs offers fast access, its limited capacity necessitates reliance on host memory (CPU DRAM) to support larger working sets such as the KVCache. However, the maximum DRAM capacity is constrained by the limited number of memory channels per CPU socket. To overcome this limitation, current systems often adopt RDMA-based disaggregated memory pools, which introduce significant challenges including high access latency, complex communication protocols, and synchronization overhead. Fortunately, the emerging CXL technology introduces new opportunities in KVCache design. In this paper, we propose Beluga, a novel memory architecture that enables GPUs and CPUs to access a shared, large-scale memory pool through CXL switches. By supporting native load/store access semantics over the CXL fabric, our design delivers near-local memory latency, while reducing programming complexity and minimizing synchronization overhead. We conduct a systematic characterization of a commercial CXL switch-based memory pool and propose a set of design guidelines. Based on Beluga, we design and implement Beluga-KVCache, a system tailored for managing the large-scale KVCache in LLM inference. Beluga-KVCache achieves an 89.6% reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and 7.35x throughput improvement in the vLLM inference engine compared to RDMA-based solutions. To the best of our knowledge, Beluga is the first system that enables GPUs to directly access large-scale memory pools through CXL switches, marking a significant step toward low-latency, shared access to vast memory resources by GPUs."}
