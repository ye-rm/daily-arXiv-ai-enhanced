Computing-in-Memory (CIM)\noffers a promising solution by storing document embeddings in CIM macros and\nenabling in-situ parallel retrievals but is constrained by either low memory\ndensity or limited computational accuracy. To address these challenges, we\npresent DIRCRAG, a novel edge RAG acceleration architecture leveraging Digital\nIn-ReRAM Computation (DIRC). DIRC integrates a high-density multi-level ReRAM\nsubarray with an SRAM cell, utilizing SRAM and differential sensing for robust\nReRAM readout and digital multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. By storing all\ndocument embeddings within the CIM macro, DIRC achieves ultra-low-power,\nsingle-cycle data loading, substantially reducing both energy consumption and\nlatency compared to offchip DRAM. A query-stationary (QS) dataflow is supported\nfor RAG tasks, minimizing on-chip data movement and reducing SRAM buffer\nrequirements. We introduce error optimization for the DIRC ReRAM-SRAM cell by\nextracting the bit-wise spatial error distribution of the ReRAM subarray and\napplying targeted bit-wise data remapping. An error detection circuit is also\nimplemented to enhance readout resilience against deviceand circuit-level\nvariations. Simulation results demonstrate that DIRC-RAG under TSMC40nm process\nachieves an on-chip non-volatile memory density of 5.18Mb/mm2 and a throughput\nof 131 TOPS. It delivers a 4MB retrieval latency of 5.6{\\mu}s/query and an\nenergy consumption of 0.956{\\mu}J/query, while maintaining the retrieval\nprecision."}

While widely used, the\npotential impact of PRNG statistical quality on computational results remains\nunderexplored. In this study, we investigate whether differences in PRNG\nquality, as measured by standard statistical test suites, can influence\noutcomes in representative stochastic applications. Seven PRNGs were evaluated,\nranging from low-quality linear congruential generators (LCGs) with known\nstatistical deficiencies to high-quality generators such as Mersenne Twister,\nPCG, and Philox. We applied these PRNGs to four distinct tasks: an\nepidemiological agent-based model (ABM), two independent from-scratch MNIST\nclassification implementations (Python/NumPy and C++), and a reinforcement\nlearning (RL) CartPole environment. Each experiment was repeated 30 times per\ngenerator using fixed seeds to ensure reproducibility, and outputs were\ncompared using appropriate statistical analyses. Results show that very poor\nstatistical quality, as in the ''bad'' LCG failing 125 TestU01 Crush tests,\nproduces significant deviations in ABM epidemic dynamics, reduces MNIST\nclassification accuracy, and severely degrades RL performance. In contrast,\nmid-and good-quality LCGs-despite failing a limited number of Crush or BigCrush\ntests-performed comparably to top-tier PRNGs in most tasks, with the RL\nexperiment being the primary exception where performance scaled with\nstatistical quality. Our findings indicate that, once a generator meets a\nsufficient statistical robustness threshold, its family or design has\nnegligible impact on outcomes for most workloads, allowing selection to be\nguided by performance and implementation considerations. However, the use of\nlow-quality PRNGs in sensitive stochastic computations can introduce\nsubstantial and systematic errors."}

This work extends previous efforts toward\ndeveloping models for practical MC systems by proposing a more realistic TX\nmodel that incorporates the delay in SM release and TX noise introduced by\nbiological components. Building on this more realistic, functionalized\nvesicle-based TX model, we propose two novel modulation schemes specifically\ndesigned for this TX to mitigate TX-induced memory effects that arise from\ndelayed and imperfectly controllable SM release.

Particularly when the\ntraining data samples are large high-dimensional arrays, efficient training\nmethodologies that can reduce the computational costs are crucial. To reduce\nthe training cost, we propose a Multi-Resolution Model Fusion (MRMF) method\nthat combines models trained on reduced-resolution data and then refined with\ndata in the original resolution. We demonstrate that these reduced-resolution\nmodels and datasets could be generated quickly. More importantly, the proposed\napproach reduces the training time by speeding up the model convergence in each\nfusion stage before switching to the final stage of finetuning with data in its\noriginal resolution. This strategy ensures the final model retains\nhigh-resolution insights while benefiting from the computational efficiency of\nlower-resolution training. Our experiment results demonstrate that the\nmulti-resolution model fusion method can significantly reduce end-to-end\ntraining time while maintaining the same model accuracy.

MoE models rely on expert\nparallelism (EP) to alleviate memory bottleneck, which introduces all-to-all\ncommunication to dispatch and combine tokens across devices. However, in\nwidely-adopted GPU clusters, high-overhead cross-node communication makes\nall-to-all expensive, hindering the adoption of EP. Recently, wafer-scale chips\n(WSCs) have emerged as a platform integrating numerous devices on a wafer-sized\ninterposer. WSCs provide a unified high-performance network connecting all\ndevices, presenting a promising potential for hosting MoE models. Yet, their\nnetwork is restricted to a mesh topology, causing imbalanced communication\npressure and performance loss. Moreover, the lack of on-wafer disk leads to\nhigh-overhead expert migration on the critical path.\n  To fully unleash this potential, we first propose Entwined Ring Mapping\n(ER-Mapping), which co-designs the mapping of attention and MoE layers to\nbalance communication pressure and achieve better performance. We find that\nunder ER-Mapping, the distribution of cold and hot links in the attention and\nMoE layers is complementary. Therefore, to hide the migration overhead, we\npropose the Non-invasive Balancer (NI-Balancer), which splits a complete expert\nmigration into multiple steps and alternately utilizes the cold links of both\nlayers. Evaluation shows ER-Mapping achieves communication reduction up to 62%.\nNI-Balancer further delivers 54% and 22% improvements in MoE computation and\ncommunication, respectively.

However, its use is severely restricted\nby the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially for small cohorts\nwith rare diseases. High-quality, structured data is essential for the\ndevelopment of predictive medical AI. In this case study, we propose a novel,\nmulti-stage approach to secure AI training: (1) The model is designed on a\nsimulated clinical knowledge graph (cKG). This graph is used exclusively to\nrepresent the structural characteristics of the real cKG without revealing any\nsensitive content. (2) The model is then integrated into the FeatureCloud (FC)\nfederated learning framework, where it is prepared in a single-client\nconfiguration within a protected execution environment. (3) Training then takes\nplace within the hospital environment on the real cKG, either under the direct\nsupervision of hospital staff or via a fully automated pipeline controlled by\nthe hospital. (4) Finally, verified evaluation scripts are executed, which only\nreturn aggregated performance metrics. This enables immediate performance\nfeedback without sensitive patient data or individual predictions, leaving the\nclinic. A fundamental element of this approach involves the incorporation of a\ncKG, which serves to organize multi-omics and patient data within the context\nof real-world hospital environments. This approach was successfully validated\nduring the TUM.ai Makeathon 2024 (TUMaiM24) challenge set by the Dr. von Hauner\nChildren's Hospital (HCH-LMU): 50 students developed models for patient\nclassification and diagnosis without access to real data.

Agents execute the same\nalgorithm, which they start when activated by an adversary or by an agent\nentering their initial node. When activated, agents traverse edges of the\nnetwork in synchronous rounds. Their perception and communication are strictly\nlocal. This task, known as gathering, is a central problem in distributed\nmobile systems. Most prior work focuses on minimizing its time complexity,\ni.e., the worst-case number of rounds between the start of the earliest agent\nand the task completion. To break possible symmetries, deterministic solutions\ntypically assume that agents have pairwise distinct IDs, called labels, known\nonly to themselves. But must all labels be pairwise distinct to guarantee\ndeterministic gathering?\n  We address this question by considering agents that may share the same label.\nA team L is said to be gatherable if, for every initial setting of L, there is\nan algorithm that solves gathering. Our contribution is threefold. (1) We give\na full characterization of the gatherable teams. (2) We design an algorithm\nthat gathers all of them in poly$(n,\\log\\lambda)$ time, where $n$ (resp.\n$\\lambda$) is the graph order (resp. the smallest label in L).
